    abstract = {In this paper some applications of dexterous robotic hands to fine manipulation operations are discussed. Common to this kind of operations is the important role played by the frictional characteristics of the fingers and of manipulated objects. The paper discusses a procedure for measuring apparent coefficients of friction between the fingertips and manipulated objects. To take into account real contact phoenomena, the distinction is introduced between translational and rotational friction limits. Reported experiments rely on force-based (intrinsic) contact sensing devices, implemented in the phalanges of an articulated robot hand (Salisbury Hand). Data collected during these procedures can be subsequently used for tasks such as recognizing the superficial features of objects, controlling the internal grasp forces exerted by the hand on delicate objects, and following the contours of the surface of unknown objects.},

The emphasis is on developing a robust manipulation process that allows fingers to traverse the surface of an object. The process consists of a sequence of phases in which some fingers are responsible for grasping and manipulating the object while others roll and slide over the object surface. The rolling/sliding fingers can utilize sensors to determine surface properties such as texture, friction or small features such as grooves and ridges. Simulations and experiments with a two-fingered hand were conducted to investigate the robustness of the approach for exploring various object shapes},

@incollection{Cutkosky2008Force,
    abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of force and tactile sensing, with the primary emphasis placed on tactile sensing. We begin by presenting some basic considerations in choosing a tactile sensor and then review a wide variety of sensor types, including proximity, kinematic, force, dynamic, contact, skin deflection, thermal, and pressure sensors. We also review various transduction methods, appropriate for each general sensor type. We consider the information that these various types of sensors provide in terms of whether they are most useful for manipulation, surface exploration or being responsive to contacts from external agents.
                          
                          
                            Concerning the interpretation of tactile information, we describe the general problems and present two short illustrative examples. The first involves intrinsic tactile sensing, i.e., estimating contact locations and forces from force sensors. The second involves contact pressure sensing, i.e., estimating surface normal and shear stress distributions from an array of sensors in an elastic skin.
                          
                          
                            We conclude with a brief discussion of the challenges that remain to be solved in packaging and manufacturing damage-tolerant tactile sensors.},

Despite appearing very often in practice (e.g. in parallel manipulators, reconfigurable robots, or molecular compounds), there is a lack of general tools to effectively analyze the complex configuration spaces of such systems. This paper describes the {CUIK} suite, an open-source toolbox for motion analysis of general closed-chain mechanisms. The package can determine the motion range of the whole mechanism or of some of its parts, detect singular configurations leading to control or dexterity issues, or find collision- and singularity-free paths between given configurations.

It has been developed in the context of a multidisciplinary project which aims at understanding how humans perform the manipulation of objects in order to replicate grasping and in-hand movements with an artificial hand. This has required the development of a new hand with a high level of both anthropomorphism and dexterity. The hand must exactly replicate the kinematics of the human hand, adding up to 24 degrees of mobility and 20 degrees of freedom, which is a design challenge if a high level of dexterity must be guaranteed. Three key concepts have guided the mechanical design: modularity, backdrivability and mechanical simplicity. A modular approach simplifies the complex hand assembly and permits us to concentrate our efforts on one basic unit which will be replicated throughout the hand. Mechanical simplicity and backdrivability ensure a good natural mechanical behavior, essential for stable control of contact forces. Likewise, a better controllability will enhance the dexterity of the hand. A thorough mechanical design assures backdrivability through the whole mechanism, including actuators and transmission of movement to the joints. Experimental results confirm the validity of the design approach and will open new lines of research into robotic hands.},

The gripper consists of two fingers, each with two links, and is actuated using a single active tendon. During unobstructed closing, the distal links remain parallel, for parallel grasps. If the proximal links are stopped by contact with an object, the distal links start flexing, creating a stable enveloping grasp. We optimize the route of the active flexor tendon and the route and stiffness of a passive extensor tendon in order to achieve this behavior. We show how the resulting gripper can also execute fingertip grasps for picking up small objects off a flat surface, using contact with the surface to its advantage through passive adaptation. Finally, we introduce a method for optimizing the dimensions of the links in order to achieve enveloping grasps of a large range of objects, and apply it to a set of common household objects.},

The primary focus of this paper will be on the novel simplified design of the {iHY} Hand, which was developed by choosing a set of target tasks around which the hand was optimized. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of underactuated fingers that are capable of both firm power grasps and low-stiffness fingertip grasps using only the compliant mechanics of the fingers. Experimental results demonstrate successful grasping of a wide range of target objects, the stability of fingertip grasping, and the ability to adjust the force exerted on grasped objects using high-impedance actuators and underactuated fingers.},

    abstract = {Motivated by the requirements of mobile manipulation, a compliant underactuated hand, capable of locking individual joints, has been developed. Locking is accomplished with electrostatic brakes in the joints and significantly increases the maximum pullout forces for power grasps. In addition, by locking and unlocking joints, the hand can adopt configurations and grasp sequences that would otherwise require a fully actuated solution. Other features of the hand include an integrated sensing suite that uses a common transduction technology on flexible printed circuits for tactile and proprioceptive sensing. The hand is analyzed using a three-dimensional rigid body analysis package with efficient simulation of compliant mechanisms and contacts with friction. This package allows one to evaluate design tradeoffs among link lengths, required tendon tensions, spring stiffnesses and braking requirements to grasp and hold a wide range of objects. Results of grasping and pullout tests confirm the utility of the simulations.},

@article{Inouye2014Anthropomorphic,
    abstract = {How functional versatility emerges in vertebrate limbs in spite of their anatomical complexity is a longstanding question. In particular, fingers are actuated by numerous muscles pulling on tendons following intricate paths. In contrast, the tendon-driven robotic hands with intuitive tendon routings preferred by roboticists for their ease of analysis and control do not perform at the level of their biological counterparts. Thus there is much debate on whether and how the anatomy of the human hand contributes to grasp capabilities. These parallel questions in biology and robotics arise partly because it is unclear how the number and routing of tendons offer functional benefits. We use a novel computational approach that analyzes tendon-driven systems and quantifies grasp quality to compare the precision grasp capabilities of thousands of robotic index finger and thumb designs vs. the capabilities measured in human hands. Our exhaustive search finds that neither the symmetrical designs sometimes preferred by roboticists nor randomly generated designs approach the grasp capabilities of the human hand (they are on average 73\% weaker). However, optimizing for anatomically plausible asymmetry in joint centers, tendon routings, and maximal tendon tensions produces designs that can exceed the human hand by 13–45\%, and outperform the preferred robotic designs by up to 435\%. Thus, the grasp capabilities of prosthetic or anthropomorphic hands can be greatly improved by judiciously altering design parameters, at times in counter-intuitive ways. Moreover we conclude that, in addition to its other capabilities, the human hand's anatomy is very advantageous for precision grasp as it greatly outperforms numerous alternative robotic designs.},

@article{Shirafuji2014Development,
    abstract = {Our paper proposes a tendon-driven robotic finger based on an anatomical model of a human finger and a suitable method for its analysis. Our study aims to realize an anthropomorphic robotic hand that has the same characteristics and dexterity as that of a human hand, and it also aims to identify the advantages of the human musculoskeletal structure for application to the design and control of robot manipulators. When designing an anthropomorphic robotic hand, several devices are required to apply the human finger structure to a tendon-driven robotic finger. Reasons for this include that one of the human finger muscles, namely, the lumbrical muscle, is situated between tendons, which is an unfavorable configuration for the tendon-driven mechanism. Second, unlike a standard pulley used in a tendon-driven mechanism, some moment arms of the human finger change nonlinearly according to the joint angle. In our robotic finger design, we address these difficulties by rearranging its tendons and develop a mechanism to change the moment arm. We also propose a method to analyze and control this robotic fingers coordinating joints using non-stretch branching tendons based on the human extensor mechanism with a virtual tendon Jacobian matrix and the advantage is that this constraint virtually reduces the degrees-of-freedom ({DOF}) of the mechanism. Further, we build a prototype to confirm its motion using this method. In addition, we show that the state with the reduced {DOF} can be lost by external forces acting on the mechanism, and this condition can be changed manually by adjusting the tendon forces. This makes it possible to control the virtual {DOFs} to satisfy the requirements of the task. Finally, we discuss the benefits from anthropomorphic structures including the tendon arrangement, which mimic the human lumbrical muscle, and the above mentioned mechanism with non-linear moment arms from the perspective that there are two states of {DOFs}. These insights may provide new perspectives in the design of robotic hands.},

To finish the task, the robot needs to know where the object is in its hand and what action to execute. This paper presents a general statistical framework to address these problems. Given a novel object, the robot learns a statistical model of grasp state conditioned on sensor values. The robot also builds a statistical model of the requirements for a successful execution of the task in terms of uncertainty in the state of the grasp. Both of these models are constructed by offline experiments. The online process then grasps objects and chooses actions to maximize likelihood of success. This paper describes the framework in detail, and demonstrates its effectiveness experimentally in placing, dropping, and insertion tasks. To construct statistical models, the robot performed over 8,000 grasp trials, and over 1,000 trials each of placing, dropping, and insertion.},

    abstract = {This paper discusses a new experimental robot load identification method that is used in industry. The method is based on periodic robot excitation and the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters, techniques adopted from [1]. This method provides (1) accurate estimates of the robot load inertial parameters, and (2) accurate actuator torques predictions, both of which are essential for the acceptance of the results in an industrial environment. The key element to the success of this method is the comprehensiveness of the applied model, which includes beside the dynamics resulting from the robot load and motor inertia, the coupling between the actuator torques, the mechanical losses in the motors and the efficiency of the transmissions. Experimental results on a {KUKA} industrial robot equipped with a calibrated test load are presented.},

    abstract = {A conceptual approach to describing and evaluating problem- solving by robotic systems is offered. One particular problem of importance to the field of robotics, disassembly is considered. A general description is provided of an effector system equipped with sensors that interacts with objects for purposes of disassembly and that learns as a result. The system's approach is bottom up, in that it has no a priori knowledge about object categories. It does, however, have pre-existing methods and strategies for exploration and manipulation. The sensors assumed to be present are vision, proximity, tactile, position, force and thermal. The system's capabilities are described with respect to two phases: object exploration and manipulation. Exploration takes the form of executing exploratory procedures, algorithms for determining the substance, structure and mechanical properties of objects. Manipulation involves manipulatory operators, defined by the type of motion nature of the end-effector configuration and precise parameterization. The relation of the hypothesized system to existing implementations is described, and a means of evaluating it is also proposed.},

Grasping depends on the assumption of two properties: The shape and size of the three-dimensional object and on the task that follows after grasping; hence, our interest in the integrated approach to {3-D} shape recognition. We shall present an overview of currently available and being developed algorithms for representation and recognition of three-dimensional shape of an object as perceived by visual and/or tactile sensors. For the visual sensor we assume that we have available stereo cameras or their equivalent. As the tactile sensor we use an articulated multifingered hand equipped with tactile sensory arrays as the data acquisition device. We shall present available configurations of these devices. Then we shall investigate the sensory processing, in particular, what representation schemas should be considered. We shall argue that the object-centered representation as opposed to observer-centered representation is more important for grasping. Finally, a rule based schema for the control strategies will be outlined. As examples, first some artificial geometric objects then some real laboratory objects from the blocks world will be analyzed.},

It uses multiple sensor systems (active touch and passive stereo vision) to compute three dimensional primitives that can be matched against a model data base of complex curved surface objects containing holes and cavities. The low level sensing elements provide local surface and feature matches which arc constrained by relational criteria embedded in the models. Once a model has been invoked, a verification procedure establishes confidence measures for a correct recognition. The three dimen* sional nature of the sensed data makes the matching process more robust as does the system's ability to sense visually occluded areas with touch. The model is hierarchic in nature and allows matching at different levels to provide support or inhibition for recognition.},

@article{Memolia2001Fast,
    abstract = {An algorithm for the computationally optimal construction of intrinsic weighted distance functions on implicit hyper-surfaces is introduced in this paper. The basic idea is to approximate the intrinsic weighted distance by the Euclidean weighted distance computed in a band surrounding the implicit hyper-surface in the embedding space, thereby performing all the computations in a Cartesian grid with classical and efficient numerics. Based on work on geodesics on Riemannian manifolds with boundaries, we bound the error between the two distance functions. We show that this error is of the same order as the theoretical numerical error in computationally optimal, {Hamilton–Jacobi}-based, algorithms for computing distance functions in Cartesian grids. Therefore, we can use these algorithms, modified to deal with spaces with boundaries, and obtain also for the case of intrinsic distance functions on implicit hyper-surfaces a computationally efficient technique. The approach can be extended to solve a more general class of {Hamilton–Jacobi} equations defined on the implicit surface, following the same idea of approximating their solutions by the solutions in the embedding Euclidean space. The framework here introduced thereby allows for the computations to be performed on a Cartesian grid with computationally optimal algorithms, in spite of the fact that the distance and {Hamilton–Jacobi} equations are intrinsic to the implicit hyper-surface.},

@article{Krainin2011Manipulator,
    abstract = {Recognizing and manipulating objects is an important task for mobile robots performing useful services in everyday environments. While existing techniques for object recognition related to manipulation provide very good results even for noisy and incomplete data, they are typically trained using data generated in an offline process. As a result, they do not enable a robot to acquire new object models as it operates in an environment. In this paper we develop an approach to building {3D} models of unknown objects based on a depth camera observing the robot's hand while moving an object. The approach integrates both shape and appearance information into an articulated Iterative Closest Point approach to track the robot's manipulator and the object. Objects are modeled by sets of surfels, which are small patches providing occlusion and appearance information. Experiments show that our approach provides very good {3D} models even when the object is highly symmetric and lacks visual features and the manipulator motion is noisy. Autonomous object modeling represents a step toward improved semantic understanding, which will eventually enable robots to reason about their environments in terms of objects and their relations rather than through raw sensor data.},

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small.

@article{PlattInferring,
    abstract = {Abstract \^{a} The potential utility of tactile sensors in manipulation has long been recognized. However, there are very few examples in the literature of systems that use tactile information any more complex than binary contact/no-contact sensors. This paper approximates a direct mapping between hand-object state and high-dimensional tactile measurements based on training data. Although it can be precise, tactile data provides only partial state information at any given time. Therefore, we integrate tactile information over time using a particle filter. Several variations on a basic measurement model are considered and the paper evaluates the relative utility of each one. Since we create our model from a training data set rather than building a geometric model of the manipulation interaction, the approach works well localizing difficult-to-model objects such as flexible materials or fabrics. We demonstrate that the approach can localize a haptic feature in a piece of flexible plastic to within one tenth of an inch using sensors mounted on the phalanges of human-sized fingers. All demonstrations are performed using Robonaut 2.},

@article{Swevers1997Optimal,
    abstract = {This paper discusses experimental robot identification based on a statistical framework. It presents a new approach toward the design of optimal robot excitation trajectories, and formulates the maximum-likelihood estimation of dynamic robot model parameters. The differences between the new design approach and the existing approaches lie in the parameterization of the excitation trajectory and in the optimization criterion. The excitation trajectory for each joint is a finite Fourier series. This approach guarantees periodic excitation which is advantageous because it allows: 1) time-domain data averaging; 2) estimation of the characteristics of the measurement noise, which is valuable in the case of maximum-likelihood parameter estimation. In addition, the use of finite Fourier series allows calculation of the joint velocities and acceleration in an analytic way from the measured position response, and allows specification of the bandwidth of the excitation trajectories. The optimization criterion is the uncertainty on the estimated parameters or a lower bound for it, instead of the often used condition of the parameter estimation problem. Simulations show that this criterion yields parameter estimates with smaller uncertainty bounds than trajectories optimized according to the classical criterion. Experiments on an industrial robot show that the presented trajectory design and maximum-likelihood parameter estimation approaches complement each other to make a practicable robot identification technique which yields accurate robot models},

In our experiments, the robot observed the changes in its proprioceptive and auditory sensory streams while performing five exploratory behaviors (lift, shake, drop, crush, and push) on 50 common household objects (e.g. bottles, cups, balls, toys, etc.). The robot was tasked with recognizing the objects it was manipulating by feeling them and listening to the sounds that they make without using any visual information. The results show that both proprioception and audio, coupled with exploratory behaviors, can be used successfully for object recognition. Furthermore, the robot was able to integrate feedback from the two modalities, to achieve even better recognition accuracy. Finally, the results show that the robot can boost its recognition rate even further by applying multiple different exploratory behaviors on the object.},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the methodology to non-trivial examples.  I. Introduction  The potential for tactile sensing and haptic perception in general in robotics is well known. Haptics can provide general {3-D} perceptual information to strengthen or substitute machine vision (if needed) as well as local, relevant knowledge to be exploited in carrying out complex manipulation tasks. In 1984 Ruzena Bajcsy, in an inspiring paper titled "What can we learn from one finger experiments?" [3], investigated the properties that could be inferred from the exploration of an o...},

    abstract = {The inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links have been automatically estimated as a result of gen eral movement. The {Newton-Euler} equations have been recast to relate linearly the measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients to the inertial parame ters, which have then been estimated by least squares. Load estimation was implemented on a {PUMA} 600 robot equipped with an R {TI} {FS}-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the {MIT} Serial Link Direct Drive Arm equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement of the load could be pre dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented on the {MIT} Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was ob tained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques estimated from motor cur rents. The match actually proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters derived by {CAD} modeling. Restrictions on the identifiability of link inertial parameters due to restricted sensing and movement near the base have been addressed. Implications of estimation accu racy for manipulator dynamics and control have been consid ered.},

    abstract = {Humans are capable of manipulating objects based solely on the sense of touch. For robots to achieve the same feat in unstructured environments, global localization of objects via touch is required. Bayesian approaches provide the means to cope with uncertainties of the real world, but the estimation of the Bayesian posterior for the full six degrees of freedom ({6-DOF}) global localization problem is computationally prohibitive. We propose an efficient Bayesian approach termed Scaling Series. It is capable of solving the full problem reliably in real time. This is a Monte Carlo approach that performs a series of successive refinements coupled with annealing. We also propose an analytical measurement model, which can be computed efficiently at run time for any object represented as a polygonal mesh. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that Scaling Series drastically outperforms prior approaches. We demonstrate general applicability of the approach on five common solid objects, which are rigidly fixed during the experiments. We also consider {6-DOF} localization and tracking of free-standing objects that can move during tactile exploration.},

In this paper, we present a tactile-driven approach that dynamically uses the robot's grasping experience to address this issue. During the grasp movement, the current contact information is used to dynamically adapt the grasping control by targeting the best matching posture from the experience base. Thus, the robot recalls and actuates a grasp it already successfully performed in a similar tactile context. To efficiently represent the experience, we introduce the grasp manifold assuming that grasp postures form a smooth manifold in hand posture space. We present a simple way of providing approximations of grasp manifolds using self-organising maps ({SOMs}). The algorithm is evaluated on three different geometry primitives - box, cylinder and sphere - in a physics-based computer simulation.},

With no image processing, this information is gained from tactile sensor arrays, multidimensional force/torque sensors or a priori knowledge. This paper presents a method for those cases, when no good quality sensors are present or measurements are to be improved by sensor fusion. An algorithm is developed to determine the contact points and inherently the surface normal from only joint angle sensors and a geometric description of the fingertip in the {3D} case. This is done by observing the constrained motion of fingers securely grasping an object.},

If a full 3-d model of the scene were available, one could use the model to estimate the stability and robustness of different grasps (formalized as form/force-closure, etc); in practice, however, a robot facing a novel object will usually be able to perceive only the front (visible) faces of the object. In this paper, we propose an approach to grasping that estimates the stability of different grasps, given only noisy estimates of the shape of visible portions of an object, such as that obtained from a depth sensor. By combining this with a kinematic description of a robot arm and hand, our algorithm is able to compute a specific positioning of the robot's fingers so as to grasp an object. We test our algorithm on two robots (with very different arms/manipulators, including one with a multifingered hand). We report results on the task of grasping objects of significantly different shapes and appearances than ones in the training set, both in highly cluttered and in uncluttered environments. We also apply our algorithm to the problem of unloading items from a dishwasher.},

    abstract = {The ability to grasp unknown objects still remains an unsolved problem in the robotics community. One of the challenges is to choose an appropriate grasp configuration, i.e., the {6D} pose of the hand relative to the object and its finger configuration. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that is based on the assumption that similarly shaped objects can be grasped in a similar way. It is able to synthesize good grasp poses for unknown objects by finding the best matching object shape templates associated with previously demonstrated grasps. The grasp selection algorithm is able to improve over time by using the information of previous grasp attempts to adapt the ranking of the templates to new situations. We tested our approach on two different platforms, the Willow Garage {PR2} and the Barrett {WAM} robot, which have very different hand kinematics. Furthermore, we compared our algorithm with other grasp planners and demonstrated its superior performance. The results presented in this paper show that the algorithm is able to find good grasp configurations for a large set of unknown objects from a relatively small set of demonstrations, and does improve its performance over time.},

In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: {PCL} (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). {PCL} presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of {3D} perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common {3D} building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. {PCL} is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of {PCL} including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

@article{Detry2011Learning,
    abstract = {We address the issue of learning and representing object grasp affordance models. We model grasp affordances with continuous probability density functions (grasp densities) which link object-relative grasp poses to their success probability. The underlying function representation is nonparametric and relies on kernel density estimation to provide a continuous model. Grasp densities are learned and refined from exploration, by letting a robot  ” play” with an object in a sequence of grasp-and-drop actions: the robot uses visual cues to generate a set of grasp hypotheses, which it then executes and records their outcomes. When a satisfactory amount of grasp data is available, an importance-sampling algorithm turns it into a grasp density. We evaluate our method in a largely autonomous learning experiment, run on three objects with distinct shapes. The experiment shows how learning increases success rates. It also measures the success rate of grasps chosen to maximize the probability of success, given reaching constraints.},

A multi-part, viewpoint-invariant model is learned incrementally from a set of roughly segmented, unregistered views, by sequentially registering and fusing the views with the incremental model. Registration is conducted by nonparametric inference of maximum-likelihood model parameters, using {Metropolis–Hastings} {MCMC} with simulated annealing. The learning of viewpoint-invariant models and the applicability of our method to pose estimation, object detection, and object recognition is demonstrated on {3D}-scan data, providing qualitative, quantitative and comparative evaluations.},

    abstract = {We formulated grasp synthesis as a single constrained optimization problem. We used a probabilistic method to represent object shapes as an implicit function. Our method can be used to build a library of an object possible grasps. In everyday life, people use a large diversity of hands configurations while reaching out to grasp an object. They tend to vary their hands position/orientation around the object and their fingers placement on its surface according to the object properties such as its weight, shape, friction coefficient and the task they need to accomplish. Taking into account these properties, we propose a method for generating such a variety of good grasps that can be used for the accomplishment of many different tasks. Grasp synthesis is formulated as a single constrained optimization problem, generating grasps that are feasible for the hand's kinematics by minimizing the norm of the joint torque vector of the hand ensuring grasp stability. Given an object and a kinematic hand model, this method can easily be used to build a library of the corresponding object possible grasps. We show that the approach is adapted to different representations of the object surface and different hand kinematic models.},

@article{Prattichizzo2012Manipulability,
    abstract = {Underactuation in robotic hands is currently attracting a lot of interest from researchers. The challenging idea of underactuation in grasping is that hands, with reduced number of actuators, supported by suitable design and control, may not suffer from reduced performances. This trend is also strengthened by recent neuroscience studies which demonstrates that also humans use sensorimotor synergies to control the hand in performing grasping tasks. In this paper, we focus on the kinematic and force manipulability analyses of underactuated robotic hands. The performances of such hands, regarded as mechanical transformers of inputs as forces and speed into outputs as object wrench and displacements, are assessed by suitably defined manipulation indices. The whole analysis is not limited by rigid-body motion assumptions, but encompasses elastic motions and statically indeterminate configurations by introducing generalized compliance at contacts and actuation. Two examples show the validity of the proposed approach to evaluate underactuated hand performances. \^{a}º We introduce the quasi-static analysis of underactuated hands including compliance. \^{a}º We focus on manipulability analysis of underactuated hands. \^{a}º Two examples show the validity of the proposed approach to evaluate underactuated hand performances.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions of dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks. Motion planning for such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom ({DoF}) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position, i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics ({IK}) problem for one or both hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible {IK} solutions at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we present two probabilistically complete {RRT}-based motion planning algorithms ({J+-RRT} and {IK}-{RRT}) that interleave the search for an {IK} solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The capabilities of combining {IK} methods and planners are shown both in simulation and on the humanoid robot {ARMAR}-{III} performing dual-arm tasks in a kitchen environment.},

The controller computes a desired wrench (force and torque) required to recover the posture when an unknown external perturbation has changed the posture of the robot. This wrench is later distributed as forces at predefined contact points via a constrained optimization, which aims at achieving the desired wrench while minimizing the Euclidean norm of the contact forces.

Computing a grasp is complicated by the high dimensionality of the hand configuration space, and the high cost of validating a candidate grasp by collision-checking and testing for force-closure. When an object is placed in a new scene, we use a novel cost function to focus our search to good regions of hand pose space for a given preshape. The proposed cost function is fast to compute and encapsulates aspects of the object, the scene, and the force-closure of the ensuing grasp. The low-cost candidate grasps produced by the search are then validated. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by testing on the 3-fingered {4DOF} barrett hand and the anthropomorphic {22DOF} shadow hand. We also propose an extension of the algorithm for two-handed grasps and demonstrate it on the {HRP3} hands. Our results show that the candidate grasps generated by our algorithm consistently have high probability of being valid for various hands, objects and scenes. Finally, we describe an implementation on a {WAM} arm with a barrett hand.},

Our algorithm extends the rapidly-exploring random tree ({RRT}) algorithm to cope with goals that are specified in a subspace of the manipulator configuration space through which the search tree is being grown. Underspecified goals occur naturally in arm planning, where the final end effector position is crucial but the configuration of the rest of the arm is not. To achieve this, the algorithm bootstraps an optimal local controller based on the transpose of the Jacobian to a global {RRT} search. The resulting approach, known as Jacobian transpose-directed rapidly exploring random trees ({JT}-{RRTs}), is able to combine the configuration space exploration of {RRTs} with a workspace goal bias to produce direct paths through complex environments extremely efficiently, without the need for any inverse kinematics. We compare our algorithm to a recently-developed competing approach and provide results from both simulation and a 7 degree-of-freedom robotic arm.},

This paper describes a representation of constrained motion for joint space planners and develops two simple and efficient methods for constrained sampling of joint configurations: Tangent Space Sampling ({TS}) and {First-Order} Retraction ({FR}). Constrained joint space planning is important for many real world problems involving redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in work space coordinates: rotating doors about fixed axes, sliding drawers along fixed trajectories or holding objects level during transport. On the other, joint space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task. In simulation, we demonstrate that our methods are faster and significantly more invariant to problem/algorithm parameters than existing techniques.},

In much previous work on grasping, the object being grasped is assumed to be the only object in the environment. Hence the grasp quality metrics and grasping strategies developed do not perform well when the object is close to obstacles and many good grasps are infeasible. We introduce a framework for finding valid grasps in cluttered environments that combines a grasp quality metric for the object with information about the local environment around the object and information about the robot's kinematics. We encode these factors in a grasp-scoring function which we use to rank a precomputed set of grasps in terms of their appropriateness for a given scene. We show that this ranking is essential for efficient grasp selection and present experiments in simulation and on the {HRP2} robot.},

@article{Brown2010Universal,
    abstract = {Gripping and holding of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The development of universal grippers able to pick up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shape and surface properties remains, however, challenging. Most current designs are based on the multifingered hand, but this approach introduces hardware and software complexities. These include large numbers of controllable joints, the need for force sensing if objects are to be handled securely without crushing them, and the computational overhead to decide how much stress each finger should apply and where. Here we demonstrate a completely different approach to a universal gripper. Individual fingers are replaced by a single mass of granular material that, when pressed onto a target object, flows around it and conforms to its shape. Upon application of a vacuum the granular material contracts and hardens quickly to pinch and hold the object without requiring sensory feedback. We find that volume changes of less than 0.5\% suffice to grip objects reliably and hold them with forces exceeding many times their weight. We show that the operating principle is the ability of granular materials to transition between an unjammed, deformable state and a jammed state with solid-like rigidity. We delineate three separate mechanisms, friction, suction, and interlocking, that contribute to the gripping force. Using a simple model we relate each of them to the mechanical strength of the jammed state. This advance opens up new possibilities for the design of simple, yet highly adaptive systems that excel at fast gripping of complex objects.},

    abstract = {The inherent uncertainty associated with unstructured grasping tasks makes establishing a successful grasp difficult. Traditional approaches to this problem involve hands that are complex, fragile, require elaborate sensor suites, and are difficult to control. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel autonomous grasping system that is both simple and robust. The four-fingered hand is driven by a single actuator, yet can grasp objects spanning a wide range of size, shape, and mass. The hand is constructed using polymer-based shape deposition manufacturing, with joints formed by elastomeric flexures and actuator and sensor components embedded in tough rigid polymers. The hand has superior robustness properties, able to withstand large impacts without damage and capable of grasping objects in the presence of large positioning errors. We present experimental results showing that the hand mounted on a three degree of freedom manipulator arm can reliably grasp 5 cm-scale objects in the presence of positioning error of up to 100\% of the object size and 10 cm-scale objects in the presence of positioning error of up to 33\% of the object size, while keeping acquisition contact forces low.},

@article{Wimbock2012Comparison,
    abstract = {Object-level control of a dexterous robot hand provides an intuitive high-level interface to solve fine manipulation tasks. In the past, many algorithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map. In a different approach, Stramigioli introduced a virtual-object based controller – called an Intrinsically Passive Controller ({IPC}). These controllers are reviewed and compared. A new controller that is similar to the {IPC} but using a virtual frame rather than a virtual object is subsequently proposed. The controllers are compared with respect to their object force distribution, the extendability to N fingers, the ease of specifying the object-level impedance and grasp forces, the dimensionality of the coupling springs, the internal controller dynamics, and the computational effort. Controllers for robotic hands usually implement only stiffness controllers and do not program the damping. We address how to choose and implement damping as a function of the desired object-level stiffness and the effective hand–object inertia. The evaluation reveals the dynamic effects of fast motions, which should not be neglected for the design of grasp controllers in practice. The application of the controllers to the torque-controlled {DLR} Hand {II} is employed to compare their effectiveness in experiments.},

Similar to the original dynamic manipulability, the proposed measure evaluates the mapping from a set of realizable joint torques to a set of resultant accelerations of the grasped object, which forms an ellipsoid under a constant internal force constraint. It is clearly shown that the internal forces not only affect the volume of the ellipsoid, but also the amount of offset of the ellipsoid, while the gravity forces simply induce an offset. A new measure, i.e., omnidirectionality, is introduced to add a penalty to the original manipulability measure, which simply evaluates the volume of the ellipsoid, depending on how much the ellipsoid is offset. Numerical examples by using a simple two-fingered robot hand are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measure.},

It has been shown that a minimal subset of the contact points that achieves form-closure can be directly identified from the optimal basic solution vector of the linear program, provided that the solution vector is nondegenerate. The proposed algorithm has a straightforward geometric interpretation, which has also been described in the paper. The primary advantage of the proposed algorithm is its computational simplicity, of which the overall complexity is {O(N}). Numerical examples have been presented to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm, which show that the computational time cost of the algorithm is much less than the existing techniques described in the literature},

@article{Bicchi2011Modelling,
    abstract = {We report on recent work in modelling the process of grasping and active touch by natural and artificial hands. Starting from observations made in human hands about the correlation of degrees of freedom in patterns of more frequent use (postural synergies), we consider the implications of a geometrical model accounting for such data, which is applicable to the pre-grasping phase occurring when shaping the hand before actual contact with the grasped object. To extend applicability of the synergy model to study force distribution in the actual grasp, we introduce a modified model including the mechanical compliance of the hand's musculotendinous system. Numerical results obtained by this model indicate that the same principal synergies observed from pre-grasp postural data are also fundamental in achieving proper grasp force distribution. To illustrate the concept of synergies in the dual domain of haptic sensing, we provide a review of models of how the complexity and heterogeneity of sensory information from touch can be harnessed in simplified, tractable abstractions. These abstractions are amenable to fast processing to enable quick reflexes as well as elaboration of high-level percepts. Applications of the synergy model to the design and control of artificial hands and tactile sensors are illustrated.},

These modifications comprise the curving of the contact area of the distal phalanx, the application of a mechanical limit to prevent hyperextension of the distal phalanx, and the application of a compliant joint between the proximal and distal phalanges. A model is developed to calculate the limits of the finger dimensions in order to achieve stable precision grasps for different object sizes. An experimental setup is used to test the grasp stability and to verify the calculated results. It is concluded that stable precision grasps exist for the combination of concavely curved distal phalanges with a mechanical limit or with a compliant joint, if the limits to the finger dimensions are satisfied.},

@article{Saxena2008Robotic,
    abstract = {We consider the problem of grasping novel objects, specifically objects that are being seen for the first time through vision. Grasping a previously unknown object, one for which a 3-d model is not available, is a challenging problem. Furthermore, even if given a model, one still has to decide where to grasp the object. We present a learning algorithm that neither requires nor tries to build a 3-d model of the object. Given two (or more) images of an object, our algorithm attempts to identify a few points in each image corresponding to good locations at which to grasp the object. This sparse set of points is then triangulated to obtain a 3-d location at which to attempt a grasp. This is in contrast to standard dense stereo, which tries to triangulate every single point in an image (and often fails to return a good 3-d model). Our algorithm for identifying grasp locations from an image is trained by means of supervised learning, using synthetic images for the training set. We demonstrate this approach on two robotic manipulation platforms. Our algorithm successfully grasps a wide variety of objects, such as plates, tape rolls, jugs, cellphones, keys, screwdrivers, staplers, a thick coil of wire, a strangely shaped power horn and others, none of which were seen in the training set. We also apply our method to the task of unloading items from dishwashers.},

@article{Howard19986,
    abstract = {It has been recently observed by Pigoski et al. [1, 2], and by Ciblak and Lipkin [3] that the Cartesian stiffness matrix associated with a linear elastic coupling between two rigid bodies is, in general, asymmetric if the resulting forces and moments do not sum to zero. In this paper, methods of differential geometry and properties of Lie groups are used to show that in any conservative system subjected to a non-zero external load, if motions in {SE}(3), the special Euclidean group of rigid body motions in three dimensions, are considered, the resulting 6 × 6 Cartesian stiffness matrix is asymmetric in any inertial (fixed) or body-fixed reference frame. We prove the general result that in any subgroup of {SE}(3), if the system is subject to external forces and moments, the Cartesian stiffness matrix is symmetric if finite displacements along the basis twists are used to generate the stiffness matrix commute. Further, we derive several useful properties of stiffness matrices using ideas from Lie theory. In particular, we offer a simple proof to show that the stiffness matrix in the body-fixed reference frame is the transpose of the stiffness matrix in the inertial reference frame, a result also derived in [3]. Finally, we outline a method to construct a symmetric stiffness matrix by choosing an appropriate moving reference frame that is not fixed to any rigid body.},

@article{Daoud2011Realtime,
    abstract = {This paper presents a global strategy for object manipulation with the fingertips with an anthropomorphic dexterous hand: the {LMS} Hand of the {ROBIOSS} team from {PPRIME} Institute in Poitiers (France). Fine manipulation with the fingertips requires to compute on one hand, finger motions able to produce the desired object motion and on the other hand, it is necessary to ensure object stability with a real time scheme for the fingertip force computation. In the literature, lot of works propose to solve the stability problem, but most of these works are grasp oriented; it means that the use of the proposed methods are not easy to implement for online computation while the grasped object is moving inside the hand. Also simple real time schemes and experimental results with full-actuated mechanical hands using three fingers were not proposed or are extremely rare. Thus we wish to propose in a same strategy, a robust and simple way to solve the fingertip path planning and the fingertip force computation. First, finger path planning is based on a geometric approach, and on a contact modelling between the grasped object and the finger. And as force sensing is required for force control, a new original approach based on neural networks and on the use of tendon-driven joints is also used to evaluate the normal force acting on the finger distal phalanx. And an efficient algorithm that computes fingertip forces involved is presented in the case of three dimensional object grasps. Based on previous works, those forces are computed by using a robust optimization scheme. In order to validate this strategy, different grasps and different manipulation tasks are presented and detailed with a simulation software, {SMAR}, developed by the {PPRIME} Institute. And finally experimental results with the real hand illustrate the efficiency of the whole approach.},

@article{Lau2011WrenchClosure,
    abstract = {In this paper, a technique to generate the wrench-closure workspace for general case completely restrained cable driven parallel mechanisms is proposed. Existing methods can be classified as either numerically or analytically based approaches. Numerical techniques exhaustively sample the task space, which can be inaccurate due to discretisation and is computationally expensive. In comparison, analytical formulations have higher accuracy, but often provides only qualitative workspace information. The proposed hybrid approach combines the high accuracy of the analytical approach and the algorithmic versatility of the numerical approach. Additionally, this is achieved with significantly lower computational costs compared to numerical methods. It is shown that the wrench-closure workspace can be reduced to a set of univariate polynomial inequalities with respect to a single variable of the end-effector motion. In this form, the workspace can then be efficiently determined and quantitatively evaluated. The proposed technique is described for a 3 degrees of freedom ({3-DOF}) and a {6-DOF} cable driven parallel manipulator. A detailed example in workspace determination using the proposed approach and comparison against the conventional numerical approach is presented.},

    abstract = {Tensegrity structures appeared in the science community about half a century ago, but they have already been applied to several heterogeneous research fields, such as architecture, civil engineering, space and even biology. Such structures keep a stable volume in space due to an intricate balance of forces between a disjoint set of rigid elements (bars) and a continuous set of tensile elements (cables). The use of tensegrity structures in robotics is still new and there exist only a handful of works about this subject. Some of their main features such as light weight, flexibility, energetic efficiency and redundancy, make them interesting candidates for both mobile robots and manipulators. In this paper, a new method to detect and avoid both internal collisions between the structure members and external collisions with the environment is presented. In this way, we are providing a fundamental tool to develop more complete form-finding procedures and path-planning strategies for tensegrity structures.},

@article{Dai2006Mobility,

However, the criterion can break down for mechanisms with special geometries, and in particular, the class of so-called overconstrained parallel mechanisms. The problem is that the criterion treats all constraints as active, even redundant constraints, which do not affect the mechanism degrees of freedom. In this paper we reveal a number of screw systems of a parallel mechanism, explore their inter-relationship and develop an original theoretical framework to relate these screw systems to motion and constraints of a parallel mechanism to identify the platform constraints, mechanism constraints and redundant constraints. The screw system characteristics and relationships are investigated for physical properties and a new approach to mobility analysis is proposed based on decompositions of motion and constraint screw systems. New versions of the mobility criterion are thus presented to eliminate the redundant constraints and accurately predict the platform degrees of freedom. Several examples of overconstrained mechanisms from the literature illustrate the results.},

In this paper, we show                 that the conventional formulation between the joint and Cartesian spaces, K                                      θ                  = J                                      T                     θ                                  K                                      p                                  J                                      θ                 , first derived by Salisbury in 1980, is only valid at the unloaded equilibrium                 configuration. Once the grasping configuration is deviated from its unloaded                 configuration (for example, by the application of an external force), the                 conservative congruence transformation should be used. Theoretical development and                 numerical simulation are presented. The conservative congruence transformation                 accounts for the change in geometry via the differential Jacobian (Hessian matrix)                 of the robot manipulators when an external force is applied. The effect is captured                 in an effective stiffness matrix, K                                      g                 , of the conservative congruence transformation. The results of this paper also                 indicate that the omission of the changes in Jacobian in the presence of external                 force would result in discrepancy of the work and lead to contradiction to the                 fundamental conservative properties of stiffness matrices. Through conservative                 congruence transformation, conservative and consistent physical properties of                 stiffness matrices can be preserved during mapping regardless of the usage of                 coordinate frames and the existence of external force.},

    abstract = {Human hands are capable of many dexterous grasping and manipulation tasks. To understand human levels of dexterity and to achieve it with robotic hands, we constructed an anatomically correct testbed ({ACT}) hand which allows for the investigation of the biomechanical features and neural control strategies of the human hand. This paper focuses on developing control strategies for the index finger motion of the {ACT} Hand. A direct muscle position control and a force-optimized joint control are implemented as building blocks and tools for comparisons with future biological control approaches. We show how Gaussian process regression techniques can be used to determine the relationships between the muscle and joint motions in both controllers. Our experiments demonstrate that the direct muscle position controller allows for accurate and fast position tracking, while the force-optimized joint controller allows for exploitation of actuation redundancy in the finger critical for this redundant system. Furthermore, a comparison between Gaussian processes and least squares regression method shows that Gaussian processes provide better parameter estimation and tracking performance. This first control investigation on the {ACT} hand opens doors to implement biological strategies observed in humans and achieve the ultimate human-level dexterity.},

The goal is to find the equilibrium configurations of the system in response to a known force/moment applied to the mechanism. The geometric constraint of the linkage defines a set of kinematics equations which are combined with equilibrium equations obtained from partial derivatives of the potential-energy function. In order to apply polynomial homotopy solver to these equations, we approximate the linear torsion spring torque at each joint by using sine and cosine functions. The results obtained from the homotopy solver are then refined using {Newton-Raphson} iteration. To demonstrate the analysis steps, we study two example planar compliant mechanisms, a four-bar linkage with two torsional springs, and a parallel platform supported by three linear springs. Numerical examples are provided together with plots of the potential energy during a movement between selected equilibrium positions.},

    abstract = {Building on the well-established form closure framework for holding rigid parts,                     in this paper we propose a new framework for holding deformable parts. We                     consider the class of deformable parts that can be modeled as linearly elastic                     polygons with a triangular finite element mesh and given stiffness matrix. We                     define the D-space (deformation-space) of a part as the C-space of all its mesh                     nodes. Free space is the intersection of the set of topology-preserving mesh                     configurations with the complement of the union of all D-obstacles that                     represent collisions of the part with finger bodies. Consider a given set of                     finger bodies in frictionless contact with a part. When positive work is needed                     to release the part, we say that it is in deform closure. We present numerical                     examples and prove two results: (1) if a contact set holds a rigid part in form                     closure, it will hold the equivalent deformable part in deform closure and (2)                     deform closure is frame invariant.                              We then consider frictionless deform closure grasps with two contact points. We                     define a measure of grasp quality based on balancing the potential energy needed                     to release the part against the potential energy that would result in plastic                     deformation. Given two jaw contacts at the perimeter nodes, we develop numerical                     algorithms to determine the optimal jaw separation based on this metric. For a                     part with n mesh nodes and p perimeter nodes, we give an                     algorithm that computes the optimal separation in time O(n3 p2 +p6 log p)                     and an approximation algorithm that runs in time O(n3 p2                 +(p2/ε)log p).},

The aim is to obtain a natural motion as a sequence of human-like postures that both capture the coupling that there exist between the fingers of the human hand and also maintain the palm oriented towards the object to be grasped. The proposed method is a sampling-based approach whose efficiency relies in the reduction of the dimensionality obtained by considering, for the finger joints, a subspace determined by the main principal motion directions that capture the coupling and, for the position and orientation of the palm, the submanifold that satisfies the orientation constraint. The approach is illustrated with an example and compared to the case where no virtual constrains are used, validating the proposal.},

The main difficulties of the problem include that the set of feasible grasps is a manifold implicitly defined by a system of non-linear equations, the high dimension of this manifold, and the multi-modal nature of typical grasp quality indices, which make local optimization methods get trapped into local extrema. The proposed procedure finds a way around these difficulties by focussing the exploration on a relevant subset of grasps of lower dimension, which is traced out exhaustively using higher-dimensional continuation techniques. Using these techniques, a detailed atlas of the subset is obtained, on which the highest quality grasp according to any desired criterion can be readily identified. Experiments on a 3-finger planar hand and on the Schunk anthropomorphic hand validate the approach.},

forces and moments acting on a body equals zero. An equilibrium grasp
may be stable or unstable. Force closed grasps are a well-known subset
of equilibrium grasps, and they are known to be stable. However, not all
stable grasps are force closed, including many common and easily
obtainable grasps. In this paper, we classify the categories of
equilibrium grasps and establish a general framework for the
determination of the stability of a grasp. In order to analyze the
stability of grasps with multiple contacts, we first model the
compliance at each contact. We develop expressions for the changes in
contact forces as a function of the rigid body relative motion between
the fingers and the grasped object. The stability of a grasp is shown to
depend on the local curvature of the contacting bodies, as well as the
magnitude and arrangement of the contact forces. We then derive results
providing simple criteria to determine the stability of a grasped
object, including the special but important limiting case of rigid
bodies where the contact compliance is zero},

@article{Griffis1991Kinestatic,
    abstract = {A new theory for the simultaneous control of force and displacement for a partially constrained end-effector is established based upon the general spatial stiffness of the manipulator. In general, the spatial stiffness of a compliant coupling that connects a pair of rigid bodies is used to map a small twist between the bodies into the corresponding interactive wrench. This mapping is based upon a firm geometrical foundation and establishes a positive-definite inner product (elliptic metric) that decomposes a general twist into a twist of freedom and a twist of compliance. A study of the invariant properties of this mapping leads to the discovery of what are defined as the eigen-screws of stiffness. Further, the spatial stiffness of a compliant coupling is modeled by theoretically replacing the coupling with a passive Stewart Platform-type parallel mechanism. It is important to recognize that this model does not depend upon the existence of a center-of-compliance. In fact, it describes a general state of spatial stiffness between any two rigid bodies. The culmination of these finding yields a practical and meaningful theory of Kinestatic Control, viz., the simultaneous regulation of force and displacement solely via the control of displacement.},

Most real world objects can be modeled using such parts.

The methodology also has two distinct features that makes it complete: corners are considered to ensure every existing grasp is found and an accessibility check is made around the part contour to avoid synthesizing impossible grasps. The algorithm is therefore practical while it ensures high quality grasps. Results are presented for grasp synthesis of several objects with {SARAH}, an under-actuated three-finger robotic hand.},

    abstract = {In this paper we present a new method to solve the configuration problem on robotic hands: determining how a hand should be configured so as to grasp a given object in a specific way, characterized by a number of hand—object contacts to be satisfied. In contrast to previous algorithms given for the same purpose, the method presented here allows such contacts to be specified between free-form regions on the hand and object surfaces, and always returns a solution whenever one exists. The method is based on formulating the problem as a system of polynomial equations of special form, and then exploiting this form to isolate the solutions, using a numerical technique based on linear relaxations. The approach is general, in the sense that it can be applied to any grasping mechanism involving lower-pair joints, and it can accommodate as many hand—object contacts as required. Experiments are included that illustrate the performance of the method in the particular case of the Schunk Anthropomorphic hand.},

By using powerful super flat brushless {DC} motors, tiny harmonic drivers and {BGA} form {DSPs} and {FPGAs}, the whole fingerpsilas size is about one third smaller than the former finger in the {DLR}/{HIT} Hand I. By using the steel coupling mechanism, the phalanx distalpsilas transmission ratio is exact 1:1 in the whole movement range. At the same time, the multisensory dexterous hand integrates position, force/torque and temperature sensors. The hierarchical hardware structure of the hand consists of the finger {DSPs}, the finger {FPGAs}, the palm {FPGA} and the {PCI} based {DSP}/{FPGA} board. The hand can communicate with external with {PPSeCo}, {CAN} and Internet. Instead of extra cover, the packing mechanism of the hand is implemented directly in the finger body and palm to make the hand smaller and more human like.

asymptotically stable with respect to perturbations. Moreover, it is
shown that for preloaded grasps kinematic immobility implies that the

Given the definitions of twist/wrench spaces and their subspaces of the end-effector, the underlying relationships amongst these subspaces are identified using the virtual work principle. Using the orthogonal and dual properties of these subspaces and variational representations to account for the permitted and restricted instantaneous motions of the end-effector, a rigorous general and systematic procedure for the formulation of a generalized Jacobian is proposed. The merit of the generalized Jacobian is that it allows the first order kinematic and static modeling (velocity, accuracy, force and stiffness) to be integrated into a unified mathematical framework, so standardizing the modeling procedure and improving the efficiency of design and analysis. The generalized Jacobians for the three well-known parallel manipulators are derived as examples to illustrate the generality and effectiveness of this approach.},

@incollection{Prattichizzo2008Grasping,
    abstract = {This   chapter introduces fundamental models of grasp analysis. The overall model is a coupling of models that define contact behavior with widely used models of rigid-body kinematics and dynamics. The contact model essentially boils down to the selection of components of contact force and moment that are transmitted through each contact. Mathematical properties of the complete model naturally give rise to five primary grasp types whose physical interpretations provide insight for grasp and manipulation planning.    After introducing the basic model and types of grasps, this chapter focuses on the most important grasp characteristic: complete restraint. A grasp with complete restraint prevents loss of contact and thus is very secure. Two primary restraint properties are form closure and force closure. A form closure grasp guarantees maintenance of contact as long as the links of the hand and the object are well approximated as rigid and as long as the joint actuators are sufficiently strong. As will be seen, the primary difference between form closure and force closure grasps is the latterʼs reliance on contact friction. This translates into      requiring fewer contacts to achieve force closure than form closure.},

@incollection{Billard2008Robot,
    abstract = {Robot programming by demonstration ({PbD}) has become a central  topic of robotics that spans across general research areas such as human-robot interaction, machine learning, machine vision and motor control.   Robot {PbD} started about 30 years ago, and has grown importantly during the past decade. The rationale for moving from purely preprogrammed robots to very flexible user-based interfaces for training robots to perform a task is three-fold.   First and foremost, {PbD}, also referred to as imitation learning, is a powerful mechanism for reducing the complexity of search spaces for learning. When observing either good or bad examples, one can reduce the search for a possible solution, by either starting the search from the observed good solution (local optima), or conversely, by eliminating from the search space what is known as a bad solution. Imitation learning is, thus, a powerful tool for enhancing and accelerating learning in both animals and artifacts.   Second, imitation learning offers an implicit means of training a machine, such that explicit and tedious programming of a task by a human user can be minimized or eliminated (Fig. 59.1). Imitation learning is thus a natural means of interacting with a machine that would be accessible to lay people.   Fig. 59.1   Left: A robot learns how to make a chess move (namely moving the queen forward) by generalizing across different demonstrations of the task performed in slightly different situations (different starting positions of the hand). The robot records its jointsʼ trajectories and learns to extract what-to-imitate, i.e. that the task constraints are reduced to a subpart of the motion located in a plane defined by the three chess pieces. Right: The robot reproduces the skill in a new context (for different initial position of the chess piece) by finding an appropriate controller that satisfies both the task constraints and constraints relative to its body limitation (how-to-imitate problem), adapted from [59.1]        Third, studying and modeling the coupling of perception and action, which is at the core of imitation learning, helps us to understand the mechanisms by which the self-organization of perception and action could arise during development. The reciprocal interaction of perception and action could explain how competence in motor control can be grounded in rich structure of perceptual variables, and vice versa, how the processes of perception can develop as means to create successful actions. {PbD} promises were thus multiple. On the one hand, one hoped that it would make learning faster, in contrast to tedious reinforcement learning methods or trials-and-error learning. On the other hand, one expected that the methods, being user-friendly, would enhance the application of robots in human daily environments. Recent progresses in the field, which we review in this chapter, show that the field has made a leap forward during the past decade toward these goals. In addition, we anticipate that these promises may be fulfilled very soon.   Section 59.1 presents a brief historical overview of robot Programming by Demonstration ({PbD}), introducing several issues that will be discussed later in this chapter. Section 59.2 reviews engineering approaches to robot {PbD} with an emphasis on machine learning approaches that provide the robot with the ability to adapt the learned skill to different situations (Sect. 59.2.1). This section discusses also the different types of representation that one may use to encode a skill and presents incremental learning techniques to refine the skill progressively (Sect. 59.2.4). Section 59.2.3 emphasizes the importance to give the teacher an active role during learning and presents different ways in which the user can convey cues to the robot to help it to improve its learning. Section 59.2.4 discusses how {PbD} can be jointly used with other learning strategies to overcome some limitations of {PbD}. Section 59.3 reviews works that take a more biological approach to robot {PbD} and develops models of either the cognitive or neural processes of imitation learning in primates. Finally, Sect. 59.4 lists various open issues in robot {PbD} that have yet been little explored by the field.},

@article{Cui2011Posture,
    abstract = {This paper presents a novel multifingered hand with an articulated palm that makes the hand adaptable and reconfigurable. The posture of the new multifingered hand is enhanced by the additional motion of the palm and the workspace of fingers is augmented by the palm workspace. To analyze this integrated workspace, this paper introduces finger-operation planes to relate the finger motion to the palm motion and its configuration. Normals of these operation planes are used to construct a Gauss map. Adding an additional dimension, a four-dimensional ruled surface can be generated from this map to illustrate variation of posture. With the change of palm configurations, a posture manifold can be developed from the posture ruled surfaces. The workspace analysis is developed by introducing a palm workspace-triangle. This workspace-triangle evolves into a helical workspace-triangle tube when palm inputs vary and further develops into a four-dimensional presentation. This progresses into a set of workspaces of the multifingered hand by varying the palm configuration, leading to a larger workspace of the new multifingered hand as the union of the workspaces corresponding to individual palm configuration. This paper further investigates manipulability of the multifingered hand by modeling the contact point as a hypothetical spherical joint. Based on reciprocity relationship of screw systems, the finger Jacobian matrices and the hand Jacobian matrix are established. With singular value decomposition, manipulability of each finger is explored and the hand manipulability is revealed by the diagonal nature of the Jacobian matrix of the hand.},

@article{Kim2004Nondimensionalized,
    abstract = {When a multi-fingered hand grasps an object, the ways to grasp it stably are infinite, and thus an optimal grasp planning is necessary to find the relatively optimized grasp points on object for achieving the objective of the given grasping and manipulating task. For this, we first define several grasp indices to evaluate the quality of each feasible grasp. Since the physical meanings of the defined grasp indices are different from each other, it is not easy to combine those indices to identify the optimal grasping. Thus, we propose a new generalized grasping performance index to represent all of the grasp indices as one measure based on a non-dimensionalizing technique. Next, by using the proposed grasping performance index, we try to determine the optimal grasp points for multi-fingered hands performing contact tasks. Through task-based simulation studies, we discuss the feasibility of each grasp index as the grasp polygons and then, we show that the trend of the proposed optimal grasp planning is coincident to the physical sense of human grasping. Furthermore, some experimental results showing the task specific performances are incorporated to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal grasp planning algorithms.},

@article{Mansouri2011Power,
    abstract = {Jacobian-based performance indices such as the manipulability ellipsoid, the condition number and the minimum singular value, have been very helpful tools both for mechanical manipulator design and for determining suitable manipulator postures to execute a given task. For a manipulator having complex degrees of freedom (translations and rotations), Jacobian matrix becomes non-homogeneous, i.e. it contains elements with different physical units; therefore, the evaluation of its determinant, eigenvalues or singular values needs the combination of quantities of different nature, which is physically inconsistent and moreover it corresponds to a noncommensurable system. In this paper, a new performance index of robot manipulators is proposed. It is fully homogeneous and it constitutes a physically consistent system whether the manipulator contains joints of different natures, or the task space combines both translation and rotation motion. The development is concerned with the study of power within the mechanism. Given that the power has the same physical units in translation and rotation, it can be used as a homogeneous or natural performance index of manipulators by examining the behaviour of its basic components namely, force and speed, at different kinematics configurations. Furthermore, the new concept of vectorial power is introduced, followed by to the quadrivector of apparent power, and leading to the final homogeneous performance index of the power manipulability ({PM}). This new approach matches perfectly with mechanisms having joints of different natures, as well as with a task space combining both translation and rotation.},

We begin with an exhaustive catalog of design types for the finger based on an analysis of its branch loci. We then study the condi tions under which the forward kinematic map becomes singular. These singularities define a submanifold that partitions the linkage's configuration space into a number of open sheets, each of which maps diffeomorphically onto a corresponding open region in the finger's reach able work space. Next we consider the determinant func tion of the finger's Jacobian matrix. The stationary points of this function reveal those configurations where the Jacobian determinant is a maximum. The Jacobian deter minant can be thought of as an oriented volume in the tangent space to the finger's work space, and the orienta tion of this volume reveals the most favorable direction(s) for effecting tip motion or, reciprocally, for applying tip forces. From this we establish a simple criterion that can be used to find the optimal grasp configuration(s) for a given finite displacement of the workpiece.},

While conventional manipulability is analysis in velocity domain and can not include force effect such as gravitational force, the proposing approach can include the force effect to keep grasping. For the purpose, an operation range is introduced. The operation range is for actuator attached with every joint of robot and provides generable joint torque and velocity and their relation (between generating torque/velocity and addable velocity/torque). Using the operation range, we derive manipulability set and measure in velocity domain, including force effect. The proposing method can evaluate not only the performance in velocity domain but also effects of friction, contact state, and external forces, which were not obtained in conventional studies.},

@article{Kurita2010Humansized,

The fingers are tendon-driven by wires and the actuators are embedded in the arm part. The driving forces from the arm part are transmitted to the hand part by a gear mechanism at the wrist. The gear mechanism makes the hand part and the arm part splittable. The detachable mechanism enables separate maintenance of the hand and arm parts. To avoid undesired joint mutual interferences due to the tendon-driven mechanism, a joint motion correction control is implemented in that counteracting motions are ordered to actuators. The correction coefficient can be calculated based on the mechanical configuration. The developed robot hand has the size of 200[mm](length) × 78[mm](width) × 24.6[mm](thickness) and can exert {10[N}] at the fingertip.

These vectors are called Principal Motion Directions, and represent the coordinated motions captured by a sensorized glove on a human hand and transferred to the robot hand.

@article{Cardou2010KinematicSensitivity,
    abstract = {Numerous performance indices have been proposed to compare robot architectures based on their kinematic properties. However, none of these indices seems to draw a consensus among the robotics community. The most notorious indices, which are manipulability and dexterity, still entail some drawbacks, which are mainly due to the impossibility to define a single invariant metric for the special Euclidean group. The natural consequence is to use two distinct metrics, i.e., one for rotations and one for point displacements, as has already been proposed by other researchers. This is the approach used in this paper, where we define the maximum rotation sensitivity and the maximum point-displacement sensitivity. These two indices provide tight upper bounds to the end-effector rotation and point-displacement sensitivity under a unit-magnitude array of actuated-joint displacements. Therefore, their meaning is thought to be clear and definite to the designer of a robotic manipulator. Furthermore, methods for the computation of the proposed indices are devised, some of their properties are established and interpreted in the context of robotic manipulator design, and an example is provided.},

The paper discusses thedynamics of these systems, and considers how their structural properties(in the classical system-theoretic sense, i.e., stability,controllability, observability, etc.) are related to frequently usedconcepts in robotics such as  ” redundancy”, ” graspability”,  ” mobility”, and ” indeterminacy”. Less common or novel concepts, such asthose of  ” defectivity,”  ” hyperstaticity,” and ” dynamic graspability”, are elicited and/or enlightened bythis study. Some important practical consequences of the limited controlpossibilities of defective systems are thus put into evidence. Finally,a standard form of the dynamics of general manipulation systems isprovided as a compact and readable synopsis of the dynamic {structure.The} form is a valuable tool for synthesizing dynamic controllers forsuch systems, especially suited to geometric control designmethods},

A geometric meaning of the columns of the Jacobian is demonstrated. A simple example of the appli cation of the ideas presented here to the understanding of the complex combinations of serial and parallel chains found in vehicle and multifingered hand problems is also presented. 10.1177/027836499101000503},

@article{Kerr1992Redundant,
    abstract = {This article presents a meaningful, practical, and theoretically sound solution that solves the problem of grasping a rigid object with a hand that has redundant (>6) grasping contacts. This is accomplished by introducing compliance at each contact point in such a way as to provide the engineer with the capabilities of object manipulation via controlled forces at the contact points. This method of solution is adapted straight-away to compute the static forces generated in the legs of a redundant in-parallel manipulator that equilibrates a wrench applied to the moving/platform or end-effector. In a way similar to the redundant grasping problem, this is accomplished by introducing the knowledge of the compliances that exist in the legs. The solution thus obtained stems from physical parameters that model the in-parallel manipulator. The in-depth study of the duality between the statics of in-parallel manipulators and the kinematics of serial manipulators reveals a meaningful, practical, and theoretically sound solution for the inverse kinematics of a redundant serial manipulator. This is accomplished by incorporating the knowledge of the compliances that exist or are desired to exist in the joints of the manipulator. (For instance, the torsional compliance in revolute joints or the linear compliance in prismatic joints.) Such information provides a physically meaningful model of the serial manipulator that in turn yields a physically meaningful set of joint increments for a given end-effector twist. {\copyright} 1992 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

For this, we identify a set of hand preshapes and classify them according to the grasp wrench space they generate. Given a task, the robot selects the most suitable hand preshape and automatically plans a set of actions in order to reach the object and to perform the task, taking continuously into account the task forces. The concept of hand preshape is extended for the inclusion of a task frame, which is a concept from task planning, thus filling the gap between the grasp and the task.},

@article{Park1992Grasp,
    abstract = {Grasping an object with a multifingered robot hand requires complete constraint of its motion by contacts. Complete con straint of an object can also be described using force equilib rium. If any external force on the object can be balanced by applicable contact forces, a stable grasp has been achieved. A force closure grasp is such a grasp. This article presents a simple and efficient algorithm to find an optimum force clo sure grasp of a planar polygon using a three fingered robot hand. The optimum grasp is defined as a grasp that has the minimum value of a heuristic function. The heuristic function is formulated from the consideration of the possible uncertainties inherent in implementation. Even though a planar force clo sure grasp can be obtained using only two friction contacts, we consider only grasps where all three friction contacts explicitly participate. To find the optimum grasp, all feasible combina tions of edges and/or vertices are identified first. An edges and/or vertices combination is feasible when a stable grasp is attainable by an appropriate selection of three contacts on them. Then, using computational geometry, a single grasp is constructed on each feasible combination. Finally, the grasps obtained are compared using the heuristic quality measure. A test of our algorithm on several different polygons shows that the resulting grasp is realistic and is obtained fast enough for real-time use. 10.1177/027836499201100301},

@proceedings{Montana1991Condition,
    abstract = {The author distinguishes between two types of grasp stability, called spatial grasp stability and contact grasp stability. The former is the tendency of the grasped object to return to an equilibrium location in space; the latter is the tendency of the points of contact to return to an equilibrium position on the object's surface. It is shown, via examples, that spatial stability cannot capture certain intuitive concepts of grasp stability, and hence that any full understanding of grasp stability must include contact stability. A model of how the positions of the points of contact evolve in time on the surface of the grasped object in the absence of any external force or active feedback is derived. From this model, a condition is obtained which determines whether or not a two-fingered grasp is contact stable},

The dimension of this space is not fixed but it is iteratively increased according to the difficulty of the task at hand. Initially the search space is 1-dimensional along the line defined by the initial and goal hand configurations (by construction those configurations always belong to the search space), and then its dimension is increased by iteratively adding principal motion directions (that couple the finger motions), trying in this way to produce hand movements through anthropomorphic natural postures.},

Based on the condition, it is demonstrated that the problem of computing form-closure regions can be formulated as an existence problem of a solution for a set of inequalities. A sufficient condition is also proposed to simplify the computation of form-closure regions. As to searching for optimal fingertip locations, we transform the problem to a nonlinear programming problem subject to a set of constraints arising from that sufficient and necessary condition. Furthermore, a performance index is defined by measuring the distance between the center of mass of the grasped object and the center of the contact points.

@article{Trinkle1995Firstorder,
    abstract = {A stability cell is a subset of the configuration space (C-space) of a set of actively controlled rigid bodies (e.g., a manipulator) in contact with a passive body in which the contact state is guaranteed to be stable under Coulomb friction and external forces. A first-order stability cell is a subset of a stability cell with the following two properties: the state of contact uniquely determines the rate of change of the object's configuration given the rate of change of the manipulator's configuration; and the contact state cannot be altered by any infinitesimal variation in the generalized applied force. First-order stability cells can be used in planning whole-arm manipulation tasks in a manner analogous to the use of free-space cells in planning collision-free paths: a connectivity graph is constructed and searched for a path connecting the initial and goal configurations. A path through a free-space connectivity graph represents a motion plan that can be executed without fear of collisions, while a path through a stability-cell connectivity graph represents a whole-arm manipulation plan that can be executed without fear of  ” dropping” the object. The paper gives a conceptual and analytical development of first-order stability cells of {3D} rigid-body systems as conjunctions of equations and inequalities in the C-space variables. Additionally, our derivation leads to a new quasi-static jamming condition that takes into account the planned motion and kinematic structure of the active bodies},

@article{Roa2009Computation,
    abstract = {Precision grasp synthesis has received a lot of attention in past few last years. However, real mechanical hands can hardly assure that the fingers will precisely touch the object at the computed contact points. The concept of independent contact regions ({ICRs}) was introduced to provide robustness to finger positioning errors during an object grasping: A finger contact anywhere inside each of these regions assures a force-closure grasp, despite the exact contact position. This paper presents an efficient algorithm to compute {ICRs} with any number of frictionless or frictional contacts on the surface of any {3-D} object. The proposed approach generates the independent regions by growing them around the contact points of a given starting grasp. A two-phase approach is provided to find a locally optimal force-closure grasp that serves as the starting grasp, considering as grasp quality measure the largest perturbation wrench that the grasp can resist, independently of the perturbation direction. The proposed method can also be applied to compute {ICRs} when several contacts are fixed beforehand. The approach has been implemented, and application examples are included to illustrate its performance.},

@inproceedings{Hourtash2006CXspace,
    abstract = {Grasp planning is formulated as a unified problem, fusing the previously decoupled subproblems of locating and matching contacts on the hand and on the payload. To achieve this, the problem is formulated in the {CX}-space which is denoted as the Cartesian product of the hand's configuration space (Cspace), and a space of relative poses between the hand and the payload (X-space). This approach alleviates some difficulties which are unresolved when a search is performed in the hand's C-space alone. A number of kinematic aspects of grasping are addressed by associating them with sets in the {CX}-space. Solving for a desired grasp then requires identifying a {CX}-space configuration which lies in the intersection of these sets. Rather than recommending a search technique, this paper presents the framework for this novel formulation. As a demonstration, portions of the {CX}-space associated with a simulated {Utah-MIT} hand and a spherical payload are examined},

@article{Li2007DataDriven,
    abstract = {Human grasps, especially whole-hand grasps, are difficult to animate because of the high number of degrees of freedom of the hand and the need for the hand to conform naturally to the object surface. Captured human motion data provides us with a rich source of examples of natural grasps. However, for each new object, we are faced with the problem of selecting the best grasp from the database and adapting it to that object. This paper presents a data-driven approach to grasp synthesis. We begin with a database of captured human grasps. To identify candidate grasps for a new object, we introduce a novel shape matching algorithm that matches hand shape to object shape by identifying collections of features having similar relative placements and surface normals. This step returns many grasp candidates, which are clustered and pruned by choosing the grasp best suited for the intended task. For pruning undesirable grasps, we develop an anatomically-based grasp quality measure specific to the human hand. Examples of grasp synthesis are shown for a variety of objects not present in the original database. This algorithm should be useful both as an animator tool for posing the hand and for automatic grasp synthesis in virtual environments.},

@article{Buss1998DikinType,
    abstract = {One of the central issues in dextrous robotic hand grasping is to balance external forces acting on the object and at the same time achieve grasp stability and minimum grasping effort. A compan ion paper shows that the nonlinear friction-force limit constraints on grasping forces are equivalent to the positive definiteness of a certain matrix subject to linear constraints. Further, compensation of the external object force is also a linear constraint on this ma trix. Consequently, the task of grasping force optimization can be formulated as a problem with semidefinite constraints.  In this paper, two versions of strictly convex cost functions, one of them self-concordant, are considered. These are twice-continuously differentiable functions that tend to infinity at the boundary of posi tive definiteness. For the general class of such cost functions, Dikin- type algorithms are presented. It is shown that the proposed algo rithms guarantee convergence to the unique solution of the semidef inite programming problem associated with dextrous grasping force optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate the simplicity of im plementation, the good numerical properties, and the optimality of the approach. 10.1177/027836499801700802},

In this paper, we address the problem of determining whether a desired grasp of a polyhedral object is kinematically feasible. In our study, we define a grasp in terms of a system of contact pairs between the topological features of the hand and the object, and formulate the grasp feasibility analysis as a set of equality and inequality constraints in the variables of the hand and object configurations. The feasibility of a grasp then becomes equivalent to the simultaneous satisfaction of all the constraints. This allows us to cast the feasibility analysis conveniently as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solve it numerically with commercially available software. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with an example of grasping a cuboid using a three-fingered robotic hand.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the coordination of thumb joints during opposition tasks. A total of 15 female subjects with asymptomatic hands were studied. Three-dimensional angular kinematics of the carpometacarpal ({CMC}), metacarpophalangeal ({MCP}) and interphalangeal ({IP}) joints were obtained by a marker-based motion analysis system. Thumb opposition revealed coordination among joints in a specific direction (inter-joint coordination) and among different directions within a joint (intra-joint coordination). In particular, linear couplings existed between the flexion and pronation at the {CMC} joint, and between the flexion of the {CMC} joint and flexion of the {MCP} joint. Principal component analysis showed that only two principal components adequately represented the thumb opposition data of seven movement directions. A term functional degrees of freedom by virtue of principal component analysis was proposed to uncover the extent of movement coordination in functional tasks.},

We performed a multi-stage validation of a biomechanical computer model against our measurements of maximal static thumbtip force and fine-wire electromyograms ({EMG}) from 8 thumb muscles in each of five orthogonal directions in key and opposition pinch postures. A low-friction point-contact at the thumbtip ensured that subjects did not produce thumbtip torques during force production. The {3-D}, 8-muscle biomechanical thumb model uses a 5-axis kinematic description with orthogonal and intersecting axes of rotation at the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints. We represented the 50 musculoskeletal parameters of the model as stochastic variables based on experimental data, and ran Monte Carlo simulations in the "inverse" and "forward" directions for 5000 random instantiations of the model. Two inverse simulations (predicting the distribution of maximal static thumbtip forces and the muscle activations that maximized force) showed that: the model reproduces at most 50\% of the 80 {EMG} distributions recorded (eight muscle excitations in 5 force directions in two postures); and well-directed thumbtip forces of adequate magnitude are predicted only if accompanied by unrealistically large thumbtip torques ({0.64+/-0.28Nm}). The forward simulation (which fed the experimental distributions of {EMG} through random instantiations of the model) resulted in misdirected thumbtip force vectors (within 74.3+/-24.5 degrees from the desired direction) accompanied by doubly large thumbtip torques ({1.32+/-0.95Nm}). Taken together, our results suggest that the variability and uncertainty of musculoskeletal parameters and the choice of solution method are not the likely reason for the unrealistic predictions obtained. Rather, the kinematic description of the thumb we used is not representative of the transformation of net joint torques into thumbtip forces/torques in the human thumb. Future efforts should focus on validating alternative kinematic descriptions of the thumb.},

    abstract = {The capability to equilibrate external wrenches is crucial in optimal grasp planning. This paper presents a new method for evaluating this capability when the external wrench is unknown. Two criteria are reformulated using the  L 2  distance function, and further transformed into two nonlinear optimization problems. The differentiability of the objective functions and choice of initial conditions for global optimization are discussed. Keeping all the merits, that the criteria are applicable to grasps of {3-D} objects with any contact types, and that the friction cones are not linearized, this work endows them with several new virtues: (a) Their formulation and computation are unified for both force-closure and non-force-closure grasps; (b) They are independent of the choice of coordinate frame and unit; (c) The object geometry is taken into account; (d) The computational efficiency is even higher than some methods by linearizing the friction cones.},

Two experimental prototypes of a finger, one fabricated by traditional means and another fabricated by rapid prototyping techniques, are described and used to evaluate the design. An important aspect of the Rapid Prototype technique used here is that this multi-articulated hand will be fabricated in one step, without requiring assembly, while maintaining its desired mobility. The use of Shape Memory Alloy actuators combined with the rapid fabrication of the non-assembly type hand, reduce considerably its weight and fabrication time. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the mechanical design of a dexterous hand that combines Rapid Prototype techniques and smart actuators. The type of robotic hand described in this paper can be utilized for applications requiring low weight, compactness, and dexterity such as prosthetic devices, space and planetary exploration.},

Given a geometric model of the environment and a statically-stable desired posture, we search the configuration space of the robot for a collision-free path that simultaneously satisfies dynamic balance constraints. We adapt existing randomized path planning techniques by imposing balance constraints on incremental search motions in order to maintain the overall dynamic stability of the final path. A dynamics filtering function that constrains the {ZMP} (zero moment point) trajectory is used as a post-processing step to transform statically-stable, collision-free paths into dynamically-stable, collision-free trajectories for the entire body. Although we have focused our experiments on biped robots with a humanoid shape, the method generally applies to any robot subject to balance constraints (legged or not). The algorithm is presented along with computed examples using both simulated and real humanoid robots.},

Our algorithm computes a motion strategy by maximizing the shortest distance to escape—the shortest distance the target must move to escape an observer's visibility region. Since this optimization problem is intractable, we use randomized methods to generate candidate surveillance paths for the observers. We have implemented our algorithms, and we provide experimental results using real mobile robots for the single target case, and simulation results for the case of two targets-two observers.},

To analyze this enhanced workspace, this paper introduces finger-orientation planes to relate the finger orientation to palm various configurations. Normals of these orientation planes are used to construct a Gauss map. Adding an additional dimension, a {4-D} ruled surface is generated to illustrate orientation and pose change of the hand, and an orientation–pose manifold is developed from the orientation–pose ruled surface. The orientation and workspace analysis are further developed by introducing a triangular palm workspace that evolves into a helical surface and is further developed into a {4-D} representation.

    abstract = {As foreshadowed in Part I [ Mech. Mach. Theory 27 , 1–15 (1992)] this paper further examines the acceleration of points of a rigid body in general spatial motion. Axodes (that define displacement of the body) and the derivative of a screw together provide the starting point. Whereas in Part I the emphasis is on inflections in point-paths, we now study yet another quadric surface, one that is analogous to the Bresse circle in planar motion. We relate this surface to a moving body's acceleration centre and then to the ellipsoidal acceleration field generated by the motion. While some of the properties we describe are known, others we believe are new. In particular, the time-derivative of the active screw on the axode and its relation to a two-system of screws provides useful insight into an area that has hitherto not been adequately pursued.},

@inproceedings{Han2009Explicit,
    abstract = {Multi-fingered manipulation systems are important in the study of robotics. These are also challenging systems, in part because of the loop closure constraints required of several (virtual) loops each formed by two fingers and the grasped object. Most existing work describes system configurations using joint parameters, in which loop closure constraints are expressed by highly nonlinear equations. Such a formulation amounts to an implicit parametrization of the configuration space ({CSpace}) as a lower-dimensional semi-algebraic subset embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient joint parameter space. The non-zero difference between the two dimensions is the codimension of {CSpace} as seen in the given parametrization. In this paper, we point out that, quite generally, parametrizations leading to lower codimensional configuration spaces provide multi-faceted advantages over those producing higher codimensions. For two example manipulation system—a 3-fingered hand and a planar star-manipulator with any number of fingers— we present explicit parameterizations, which are effectively of codimension 0. We base these parametrizations on our recently developed construction trees of simplices (such as triangles and tetrahedra) for multi-object systems; such a tree gives simplexbased parametrers on {CSpace}, in which loop closure constraints become simplex formation constraints (such as triangle inequalities and {Cayley–Menger} determinant constraints). Both example systems are very difficult to deal with using joint angle parameters. Our results here further demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the simplex-based approach.},

We begin by discussing the applicability of a hand                     configuration subspace to the problem of automated grasp synthesis; our results                     show that low-dimensional optimization can be instrumental in deriving effective                     pre-grasp shapes for a number of complex robotic hands. We then show that the                     computational advantages of using a reduced dimensionality framework enable it                     to serve as an interface between the human and automated components of an                     interactive grasping system. We present an on-line grasp planner that allows a                     human operator to perform dexterous grasping tasks using an artificial hand. In                     order to achieve the computational rates required for effective user                     interaction, grasp planning is performed in a hand posture subspace of highly                     reduced dimensionality. The system also uses real-time input provided by the                     operator, further simplifying the search for stable grasps to the point where                     solutions can be found at interactive rates.

The direct analysis yields a nonlinear system with eight solutions at the most. The inverse analysis is solved in three relevant cases: (i) the orientation of the moving platform is given, (ii) the position of a reference point of the moving platform is given, and (iii) two rotations (pointing) and one translation (focusing) are given. In the present paper it is proved that case (i) yields an inverse singularity condition of the mechanism; case (ii) provides a nonlinear system with four distinct solutions at the most; case (iii) allows the finding of some geometrical configurations of the actuated pairs for minimizing parasitic movements in the case of a pointing/focusing operation of the manipulator.},

Independent contact regions provide robustness in front of finger positioning errors during an object grasping, and give relevant information for finger repositioning during the object manipulation. The object is described with a mesh of surface points, so the procedure is applicable to objects of any arbitrary shape. The proposed approach uses information from the wrench space, and generates the independent regions by growing them around the contact points of a given starting grasp. A two-phase approach is also provided to find a locally optimum force-closure grasp that serves as starting grasp, considering as grasp quality measure the largest perturbation wrench that the grasp can resist with independence of the perturbation direction. The approach has been implemented and several examples are provided to illustrate its performance.},

    abstract = {The increasing demand for robotic applications in dynamic unstructured environments is motivating the need for dextrous end-effectors which can cope with the wide variety of tasks and objects encountered in these environments. The human hand is a very complex grasping tool that can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. Many research activities have been carried out to develop artificial robot hands with capabilities similar to the human hand. In this paper the mechanism and design of a new humanoid-type hand (called {TUAT}/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand) with human-like manipulation abilities is discussed. The new hand is designed for the humanoid robot {ARMAR} which has to work autonomously or interactively in cooperation with humans and for an artificial lightweight arm for handicapped persons. The arm is developed as close as possible to the human arm and is driven by spherical ultrasonic motors. The ideal end-effector for such an artificial arm or a humanoid would be able to use the tools and objects that a person uses when working in the same environment. Therefore a new hand is designed for anatomical consistency with the human hand. This includes the number of fingers and the placement and motion of the thumb, the proportions of the link lengths and the shape of the palm. It can also perform most part of human grasping types. The {TUAT}/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand possesses 20 {DOF} and is driven by one actuator which can be placed into or around the hand},

The difficulty of solving this problem for complex characters such as humans is due in part to the high dimensionality of the search space. The dimensionality is an artifact of the problem representation because most dynamic human behaviors are intrinsically low dimensional with, for example, legs and arms operating in a coordinated way. We describe a method that exploits this observation to create an optimization problem that is easier to solve. Our method utilizes an existing motion capture database to find a low-dimensional space that captures the properties of the desired behavior. We show that when the optimization problem is solved within this low-dimensional subspace, a sparse sketch can be used as an initial guess and full physics constraints can be enabled. We demonstrate the power of our approach with examples of forward, vertical, and turning jumps; with running and walking; and with several acrobatic flips.},

Using screw theory and elementary differential geometry, the concept of a grasp is axiomated and its stability characterized. Three quality measures for evaluating a grasp are then proposed. The last quality measure is task-oriented and needs the development of a procedure for modeling tasks as ellipsoids in the wrench space of the object. Numerical computations of these quality measures and the selection of an optimal grasp are addressed in detail. Several examples are given using these quality measures to show that they are consistent with measurements yielded by the authors' experiments on grasping},

The goals of this study can be articulated in four points: 1) to enumerate the degrees of freedom of the manipulation system; 2) to describe analytically all possible first-order differential motions of the system at a given configuration; 3) to evaluate in the velocity domain the functionality of a manipulation system, with respect to the task it is required to perform; and 4) to calculate the bounds for the velocities achievable by the system, given bounds on the capabilities of joint actuators. The assumptions made on the robotic system are quite general, so that many complex devices (e.g., dextrous hands, legged vehicles, whole-arm manipulators, etc.) can be dealt with in a unified and convenient framework},

In this paper we revisit these concepts for parallel robots as accuracy indices in view of optimal design. We first show that the usual Jacobian matrix derived from the input-output velocities equations may not be sufficient to analyze the positioning errors of the platform. We then examine the concept of manipulability and show that its classical interpretation is erroneous. We then consider various common local dexterity indices, most of which are based on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. It is emphasized that even for a given robot in a particular pose there are a variety of condition numbers and that their values are not coherent between themselves but also with what we may expect from an accuracy index. Global conditioning indices are then examined. Apart from the problem of being based on the local accuracy indices that are questionable, there is a computational problem in their calculation that is neglected most of the time. Finally, we examine what other indices may be used for optimal design and show that their calculation is most challenging.},

@article{Gotlih2004Base,
    abstract = {The manipulability index suggested by Yoshikava is an important tool for the design of mechanisms and their control. It represents a quantitative measure of the functionality and the ability for realizing some tasks or groups of tasks. This index is some kind of performance measure and should be taken into consideration in the design phase of a mechanism and also in the design of control algorithms.

In this paper two important properties of the manipulability index are investigated. The first part of the present work demonstrates that manipulability of a mechanism is independent of task space coordinates. In the second part, a proof of the independency of the manipulability index on the first {DOF} is given.

This invariance is important for simplification of the mechanism's Jacobian matrix and gives excellent insight into the dependences of configuration space coordinates on this index. Moreover, it proves that the manipulability index is determined only by relative positions of the mechanism itself and by the mechanism's geometry.

Finally, the properties of the manipulability index are illustrated by some examples for fundamental open kinematical chain structures.},

Two groups of grasp quality measurements can be considered: one associated with the position of contact points and the other associated with the hand configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to bridge the gap between the two grasp quality measurements by finding all possible contact points between a robotic hand and an object with given position and orientation. This way the contact points fulfill the second group of measurements. The first group of measurements can be used to find the best grasp, which could be executed on a real hand without unreachable or joint limit problems. We use a continuous collision detection algorithm and swept volume to efficiently gather all possible contact points through the entire configuration space of each finger. Results of finding contact points between the Schunk Anthromorph Hand ({SAHand}) with 13 {DOFs} and various objects in every- day's environment are presented.},

Thirty five approaches/formulas for mobility calculation are presented and their genesis, similarities and limitations are investigated. The various methods proposed in the literature for mobility calculation are grouped in two categories: approaches based on setting up the kinematic constraint equations and their rank calculation and formulas for a quick calculation of mobility without need to develop the constraint equations. We emphasize on the limits of formulas for quick calculation of mobility by applying them to a parallel robot with elementary legs and ascertaining that the results are erroneous. In fact, the formulas for quick calculation of mobility known in the literature do not fit for many classical or modern mechanisms. We explain why these formulas do not work for certain mechanisms and we propose a new formula for quick mobility calculation of parallel mechanisms with elementary legs.},

Assuming frictional contact and rounded finger tips-very mild assumptions in practice-we give new upper (and lower) bounds on the number of fingers necessary to achieve force closure grasps of {2-D} and {3-D} objects. We develop an optimality criterion based on the notion of decoupled wrenches, and use this criterion to derive optimum two and three finger grasps of {2-D} objects, and optimum three finger grasps for {2-D} objects. We present a simple O(n) algorithm for computing these optimum grasps for convex polygons, a O(n log n) algorithm for nonconvex polygons, and an O(n<sup>3</sup>) algorithm for polyhedra. In studying these optimum grasps, we derive several interesting theoretical results concerning grasp geometry},

@inproceedings{Shilane2004Princeton,
    abstract = {In recent years, many shape representations and geometric algorithms have been proposed for matching {3D} shapes. Usually, each algorithm is tested on a different (small) database of {3D} models, and thus no direct comparison is available for competing methods. We describe the Princeton Shape Benchmark ({PSB}), a publicly available database of polygonal models collected from the World Wide Web and a suite of tools for comparing shape matching and classification algorithms. One feature of the benchmark is that it provides multiple semantic labels for each {3D} model. For instance, it includes one classification of the {3D} models based on function, another that considers function and form, and others based on how the object was constructed (e.g., man-made versus natural objects). We find that experiments with these classifications can expose different properties of shape-based retrieval algorithms. For example, out of 12 shape descriptors tested, extended Gaussian images by B. Horn (1984) performed best for distinguishing man-made from natural objects, while they performed among the worst for distinguishing specific object types. Based on experiments with several different shape descriptors, we conclude that no single descriptor is best for all classifications, and thus the main contribution of this paper is to provide a framework to determine the conditions under which each descriptor performs best.},

We emphasize on the limits of this criterion by applying it to three parallel robots and ascertaining that the results are erroneous. In fact, this criterion does not fit for many classical mechanisms or modern parallel robots. We explain why this criterion does not work for certain mechanisms and we accurately limit its applicability. We found our proof on the theory of linear transformations. As far as we are aware this paper presents for the first time an accurate applicability limitation of this well known criterion with huge and long-time utilisation in analysis and synthesis of mechanisms.},

@article{Shukla2005Path,
    abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of determining the instantaneous state of mobility and constraint of a general mechanism or assembly using screw theory. This problem has been attacked before by different methods with varying success. The method presented here is very simple and applies to many types of mechanisms, with one interesting exception. This exception also eludes the {Griibler/Kutzbach} criterion. The method presented here also improves the accuracy and scope of a method presented by Konkar and Cutkosky. Note to Practitioners - This paper permits an engineer to analyze the state of constraint of an assembly, mechanism, or fixture in order to see if it is properly constrained or whether it contains unwanted overconstraints. Overconstraint can lead to locked-in stress, incorrect tolerance analysis, and lack of robustness in a design. Very small changes in the sizes of parts or positions of locators in fixtures can have large effects on locations of parts, deformation, or internal stresses. Proper constraint is desirable because it provides for only one way to assemble parts. Operator dependency is eliminated, assembly is quick and repeatable, and special skin is not needed.},

The specific task we address is: starting from a given initial grasp of a three-dimensional ({3-D}) object O, find feasible quasistatic trajectories (rolling/sliding motions and forces) for the fingertips to move O to a desired final configuration. We call this the reconfiguration problem. Our planner is based on a two-level algorithm combining a graph search on the configuration space of the object and a local planner that solves for instantaneous quasistatic motions of the entire manipulation system. The planner is used for simulating several complex reconfiguration tasks for smooth objects demonstrating the promise of our approach},

The definition of these geometrical entities is based on the Jacobian of the manipulator, and the physical meaning given to the ellipsoids is related to the capability of the mechanism to apply forces with the end effector or to move the tool in some directions of the task-space. P. Chiacchio et al. (ibid., vol.7, p.678-685, 1991) have extended this concept to the case of cooperating manipulators. Nevertheless, some questions are still open, both with respect to the basic definition and use of manipulability ellipsoids. The commenter shows by simple examples that the use of manipulability ellipsoids for multiarm systems gives misleading results, and he disagrees with the above authors' definition of ellipsoids.

    abstract = {Abstract  The complexity of computing appropriate distribution of manipulation forces among fingers of a four-fingered robot hand defined in a dynamically {Task-Space} coordinate task is addressed. Finger-object interactions are modelled as point frictional contacts, consequently, the system is indeterminate. Hence, an optimal solution does necessitate for controlling forces acting on a grasped object. A fast and efficient method for computing optimal grasping and manipulation forces is presented based on a quadratic optimisation formulation, where computation has been based on using the nonlinear factual model of contacts. Furthermore, in order to achieve grasping while in motion, the hand inverse Jacobian has to be intensively computed, consequently, we investigate an efficient approach of employing an artificial neural network for the multi-finger robot hand in which the object motion is defined in. The approach followed here is to let an {ANN} to learn the nonlinear inverse kinematics functional relating the hand joints positions and displacements to object displacement. This is done by considering the inverse hand Jacobian, in addition to the interaction between hand fingers and the object being grasped and manipulated.},

The procedure is applicable to rigid linkages (i.e., those that can only adopt a finite number of configurations) and to mobile ones (i.e., those that exhibit a continuum of possible configurations). The method is based on the fact that this problem can be reduced to finding the roots of a polynomial system of linear, quadratic, and hyperbolic equations, which is here tackled with a new strategy exploiting its structure. The method is conceptually simple and easy to implement, yet it provides solutions of the desired accuracy in short computation times.

@techreport{Diankov2008OpenRAVE,
    abstract = {One of the challenges in developing real-world autonomous robots is the need for integrating and rigorously test- ing high-level scripting, motion planning, perception, and control algorithms. For this purpose, we introduce an open-source cross-platform software architecture called {OpenRAVE}, the Open Robotics and Animation Virtual Envi- ronment. {OpenRAVE} is targeted for real-world autonomous robot applications, and includes a seamless integration of {3-D} simulation, visualization, planning, scripting and control. A plugin architecture allows users to easily write cus- tom controllers or extend functionality. With {OpenRAVE} plugins, any planning algorithm, robot controller, or sensing subsystem can be distributed and dynamically loaded at run-time, which frees developers from struggling with mono- lithic code-bases. Users of {OpenRAVE} can concentrate on the development of planning and scripting aspects of a problem without having to explicitly manage the details of robot kinematics and dynamics, collision detection, world updates, and robot control. The {OpenRAVE} architecture provides a flexible interface that can be used in conjunction with other popular robotics packages such as Player and {ROS} because it is focused on autonomous motion planning and high-level scripting rather than low-level control and message protocols. {OpenRAVE} also supports a powerful network scripting environment which makes it simple to control and monitor robots and change execution flow dur- ing run-time. One of the key advantages of open component architectures is that they enable the robotics research community to easily share and compare algorithms.},

@article{Santello1998Postural,
    abstract = {Subjects were asked to shape the right hand as if to grasp and use a large number of familiar objects. The chosen objects typically are held with a variety of grips, including  ” precision” and  ” power” grips. Static hand posture was measured by recording the angular position of 15 joint angles of the fingers and of the thumb. Although subjects adopted distinct hand shapes for the various objects, the joint angles of the digits did not vary independently. Principal components analysis showed that the first two components could account for >80\% of the variance, implying a substantial reduction from the 15 degrees of freedom that were recorded. However, even though they were small, higher-order (more than three) principal components did not represent random variability but instead provided additional information about the object. These results suggest that the control of hand posture involves a few postural synergies, regulating the general shape of the hand, coupled with a finer control mechanism providing for small, subtle adjustments. Because the postural synergies did not coincide with grip taxonomies, the results suggest that hand posture may be regulated independently from the control of the contact forces that are used to grasp an object.},

@phdthesis{Cornella2007Geometrical,
    abstract = {Grasping and manipulation of objects are fundamental tasks in robotics, required in many applications ranging from pick and place to assembly operations. These tasks are executed by means of the end-effector of the robot, which is usually designed to accomplish a specific task with specific objects. The current end-effectors used in the industry have reached a high degree of development and sophistication, executing the task for which have been designed with a high reliability in terms of repeatability, precision or execution speed. Nevertheless, the operating flexibility of these end-effectors is still limited and their performances frequently decrease drastically when small variations affect the task, the environment or the object for which they have been designed. Furthermore, the robots are being required to work in more unstructured environments and service applications, such as home or space applications. In these situations, the flexibility of the end-effector acquires more relevance, motivating the development of more general purpose end-effectors. The human hand is the clearest paradigm of high operating flexibility tool, able to grasp and to manipulate a wide range of objects with different shapes and sizes. Then, it is natural the proposal of developments of mechanical devices imitating the human hand performance. The advantages of the mechanical hands with respect to the conventional end-effectors are the result of increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the device, which also increase the complexity of the overall system. Some of the most significant problem are related both with hardware issues (actuation, sensing,...) and software issues (control techniques, grasp synthesis algorithms,...). This thesis deals with the development of grasp synthesis algorithms following the mechanical approach. In this approach, the physical and mechanical properties of the hand, the object and the contact points between them are analyzed, in order to obtain mathematical models of these properties and to identify suitable parameters to quantify them and evaluate the goodness of the grasp. Namely, this thesis focuses on the development of grasp synthesis algorithms able to generate grasps that fulfill the basic properties of disturbance resistance and equilibrium. These two properties take into account the characteristics of the object, the position of the contact points and the contact models, in order to assure that the mechanical hand is able to balance any external force applied on the object by exerting appropriated forces at the contact points. The obtention of grasps with these properties entails to solve two specific problems: the grasp synthesis, which consists in the determination of the contact points between the fingertips and the object, and the force distribution problem, which consists in the determination of the contact forces that the fingers must exert in order to hold the object. In general, a mechanical hand is a high redundant end-effector, implying that these problems may have multiple solutions. Then, the objective of this thesis is the determination of the optimal solution taking into account some of the optimization criteria well established in the literature. The computational cost of the algorithms developed to determine the optimal grasp and the optimal grasping forces is usually a factor that hinders their applications in systems with time constraints. Then, the proposed approaches try to avoid hard iterative procedures and to obtain analytical expressions for the optimal grasp determination whenever is possible. The thesis includes several examples of the proposed methodologies, showing their efficiency and applicability.},

    abstract = {An optimal force distribution scheme of multiple cooperating
robots is proposed. General formulations of the optimal force
distribution problem are built into quadratic programming with linear
equality and quadratic inequality constraints. The quadratic constraints
are due to the norm constraints of grasping forces and the approximation
of maximum joint torque constraints which is used for simplification of
the problem. This paper presents a technique for solving these general
optimal force distribution problems. The original problem is transformed
into a compact problem by eliminating the linear equality constraints.
Then, the compact problem is transformed into a dual problem to be
solved by using Lagrange multipliers and nonlinear programming dual
method. This technique reduces the problem size considerably and makes
the problem almost unconstrained so that no initial feasible points are
needed. These features exhibit the efficiency of this technique.
Simulation results for two cooperating {PUMA} robots indicating the

    abstract = {In the last two years, a dextrous hydraulic hand has been developed at the Lehrstuhl B fur Mechanik. As with all dextrous hands, in order to be able to manipulate objects effectively, the {TUM} Hand requires not only a sound construction and robust low-level control but also high level grasp planning. This paper discusses some of the high level grasp strategies used with the {TUM} Hand. The strategies presented have two main functions: the calculation of the grasp points and finger forces, and the positioning of the object within the hand. First, methods for calculating the grasp points and finger forces are presented. A decomposition of the finger forces into their normal and tangential, rather than internal and manipulation components is used. Once the grasp points and the finger forces are known, the problem of correctly placing the object within the hand can be considered. This paper describes the method used to locate and orient the hand relative to the object such that the fingers can reach their corresponding grasp points},

@article{Cheng1991Optimal,
    abstract = {The force-distribution problem in multiple-chain robotic systems is to solve for the setpoints of the chain contact forces and input joint torques for a particular system task. It is usually underspecified, and an optimal solution may be obtained. The generality of the compact-dual linear programming ({LP}) method that can accept a variety of linear objective functions for different applications over a wide range of multiple-chain systems (multilegged vehicles, dexterous hands, and multiple manipulators) is demonstrated; and the solutions for several common problems of force distribution including slippage avoidance, minimum effort, load balance, and temporal continuity are proposed. This is illustrated by solving the force-distribution problem of a grasping system being developed called Digits. Efficiency considerations and elimination of redundant constraints are also discussed. With four fingers grasping an object, considering a conservative friction coefficient (for safety margins on friction constraints) and using a combined objective function for achieving the goals of minimum effort, load balance, and temporal continuity, the {CPU} time on a {VAX}-11/785 computer is less than 45 ms (using a linear programming package in the {IMSL} library). Therefore, it is believed that rather general use of the compact-dual {LP} method may be made to define a suitable objective function for a particular application and to solve the corresponding force-distribution problem in real time},

We show how this can be achieved by introducing a new biology-based joint axis that simulates natural joint motion and a set of constraints that reduce an estimated 150 possible motions to twelve. The model is based on observation and literature. To facilitate testing and evaluation, we present a simple low polygon count skin that can stretch and bulge. To evaluate we first introduce a hand-motion taxonomy in a two-dimensional parameter space based on tasks that are evolutionary linked to the environment. Second, we discuss and test the model. The appendix shows motion sequences of the model and the real hand. Animations can be fetched from our website.},

Second, the cooperative motion of two fingers is analyzed and control procedures are constructed for the fingers for locating objects at a desired position and in a desired orientation precisely under the condition such that each fingertip is considered globe-shaped. The cooperative motion of two fingers generating simultaneous finger operations is studied only in a situation in which the relative positions of the fingers and the grasped object are kept the same as those in the initial state. Third, the programming of several manual tasks is discussed, and experimental results are presented which verify the success made toward the programmable automation of manual tasks by multijointed fingers.},

We demonstrate that nonforce-closure grasps are two convex polytopes in the space of n parameters that represent grasp points on sides of the polygon. Therefore, the force-closure grasp region is calculated by subtracting the convex polytopes from the parameter space. The qualitative test algorithm takes O(n<sup>3</sup>) time and the grasp computation algorithm takes O(n<sup>3</sup> log n) time for n⩽3 and O(n<sup>3n/2 </sup>) time for n>3, where n is the number of the fingers.

The thumb has four joints with four-degrees-of-freedom ({DOF}), the other fingers have four joints with {3-DOF}, and two axes of the joints near the palm cross orthogonally at one point, as is the case in the human hand. The Gifu hand {II} can be equipped with six-axes force sensor at each fingertip, and a developed distributed tactile sensor with 624 detecting points on its surface. The design concepts and specifications of the Gifu hand {II}, the basic characteristics of the tactile sensor, and the pressure distributions at the time of object grasping are described and discussed herein. Our results demonstrate that the Gifu hand {II} has a high potential to perform dexterous object manipulations like the human hand.},

In our study, we define a desired grasp in terms of a set of contact pairs between the topological features of the hand and the object, and formulate a general algorithm that makes use of constrained optimization with nonlinear constraints to determine the feasibility. We first derive the conditions in order for the hand to make the desired contact and avoid undesirable collision. These conditions are expressed in terms of equalities and inequalities in the configuration variables of the hand and object, which can then easily be transformed into a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the solution.},

@article{Markenscoff1990Geometry,
    abstract = {A form closure (or complete restraint) of a solid object is a finite set of wrenches (force-moment combinations) applied on the object, with the property that any other wrench acting on the object can be balanced by a positive combination of the original ones. Intuitively, form closure is a way of defining the notion of a "firm grip" of the object (when friction is not taken into account). It has been pointed out by Reuleaux (1875) and Somoff (1897), and more recently by Lakshmin arayana (1978), that the form closure of a two-dimensional object requires at least four wrenches, and that form closure of a three-dimensional object requires at least seven wrenches. It was also conjectured that these numbers can be achieved by wrenches realizable as forces normal to the surface of the object (such wrenches are called fingers). In this paper we prove this conjecture. In particular we show that form closure of any two-dimensional bounded object with piecewise smooth boundary (except a circle) can be achieved by four fingers. For three dimensions, we prove that form closure of any bounded object with piecewise smooth boundary can be achieved with 12 fingers if and only if the object does not have a rotational symmetry (in which case, of course, form closure is not achievable, since no moment along the axis of symmetry can be opposed). We also show that, under very general conditions, form closure of three-dimensional objects without rotational symmetries can be achieved with seven fingers. Finally, we show that when Coulomb friction is taken into account, under the most relaxed assumptions three fingers are necessary and sufficient in two dimensions, and four fingers in three dimensions. 10.1177/027836499000900102},

@article{Ponce1997Computing,

We consider the case of a hand equipped with four hard fingers and assume point contact with friction. We prove new necessary and sufficient conditions for equilibrium and force closure, and present a geometric characterization of all possible types of four-finger equilibrium grasps. We then focus on concurrent grasps, for which the lines of action of the four contact forces all intersect in a point. In this case, the equilibrium conditions are linear in the unknown grasp parameters, which reduces the problem of computing the stable grasp regions in configuration space to the problem of constructing the eight-dimensional projec tion of an ll-dimensinnal polytope. We present two projection methods: the first one uses a simple Gaussian elimination ap proach, while the second one relies on a novel output-sensitive contour-tracking algorithm. Finally, we use linear optimization within the valid configuration space regions to compute the maximal object regions where fingers can be positioned inde pendently while ensuring force closure. We have implemented the proposed approach and present several examples. 10.1177/027836499701600102},

    abstract = {A new definition of grasping and manipulating forces for multifingered robot hands is proposed. First, a short discussion of the grasping and manipulating forces for two-fingered hands with linear motion is given to explain the motivation more clearly and to give the basic idea of the new definition. Then, for three-fingered hands, based on a representation of the internal force, the grasping force is defined as an internal force that satisfies the static friction constraint. The concept of grasp mode is also introduced. The manipulating force is then defined as a fingertip force that satisfies the following three conditions: (1) it produces the specified resultant force, (2) it is not in the inverse direction of the grasping force, (3) and it is orthogonal to the grasping force component. An algorithm for decomposing a given fingertip force into manipulating and grasping forces is presented. Extensions of the result to cases of two-fingered hands with planar motion and four-fingered hands are discussed. Finally, a simple example of synthesizing fingertip force for a given manipulation task is given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed definition},

The finger-object interactions are modeled as point contacts. The system is statically indeterminate, and an optimal solution for this problem is desired for force control. A fast and efficient suboptimal method for computing the grasping forces is presented. In addition to determining the equilibrating forces (the forces required to maintain equilibrium), it is essential to superpose interaction forces (the forces which squeeze the object) to ensure that the fingers do not slip. The decomposition of the equilibrating forces into forces perpendicular and parallel to the load wrench provides a useful simplification. If it is assumed that the normals to the object at the point of contract pass through the centroid of the contact points, the computations required to find the interaction forces are considerably simplified. Some simple grasps are used to evaluate the proposed algorithms},

@article{Buss1996Dextrous,
    abstract = {A key goal in dextrous robotic hand grasping is to balance external forces and at the same time achieve grasp stability and minimum grasping energy by choosing an appropriate set of internal grasping forces. Since it appears that there is no direct algebraic optimization approach, a recursive optimization, which is adaptive for application in a dynamic environment, is required. One key observation in this paper is that friction force limit constraints and force balancing constraints are equivalent to the positive definiteness of a certain matrix subject to linear constraints. Based on this observation, we formulate the task of grasping force optimization as an optimization problem on the smooth manifold of linearly constrained positive definite matrices for which there are known globally exponentially convergent solutions via gradient flows. There are a number of versions depending on the Riemannian metric chosen, each with its advantages, Schemes involving second derivative information for quadratic convergence are also studied. Several forms of constrained gradient flows are developed for point contact and soft-finger contact friction models. The physical meaning of the cost index used for the gradient flows is discussed in the context of grasping force optimization. A discretized version for real-time applicability is presented. Numerical examples demonstrate the simplicity, the good numerical properties, and optimality of the approach},

been investigated widely in developmental psychology and in anthropology.
Since robotics launched in the mid-1970s, numerous multi-fingered hands
mimicking the human hand have been designed and made in a number of
universities and research institutes, in addition to sophisticated prosthetic
hands with plural fingers.

{\_Control} Theory of Multi-fingered Hands\_ presents a comprehensive insight into
the intelligence and dexterity of robotic multi-fingered hands from both the
physical and control- theoretic viewpoints. The book:

  * focuses on the problem of how to control dexterous movements of fingers
interacting with an object in the execution of everyday tasks;

  * clarifies what kinds of sensory-motor coordinated signals are necessary
and sufficient for realising stable grasping and/or object manipulation, in
particular, the synergistic choices of control gains in co-activation signals
for finger muscles and tendons crucial in realising secure pinching motions;

  * derives a mathematical model of the dynamics of a complicated mechanism of
multiple fingers with multiple joints physically interacting; and,

  * considers the problem of how to recreate the function of "blind grasping".

It uses an elegant set of mathematical tools that emphasizes the geometry of robot motion and allows a large class of robotic manipulation problems to be analyzed within a unified framework.  The foundation of the book is a derivation of robot kinematics using the product of the exponentials formula. The authors explore the kinematics of open-chain manipulators and multifingered robot hands, present an analysis of the dynamics and control of robot systems, discuss the specification and control of internal forces and internal motions, and address the implications of the nonholonomic nature of rolling contact are addressed, as well.  The wealth of information, numerous examples, and exercises make A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation valuable as both a reference for robotics researchers and a text for students in advanced robotics courses.</P>}},

Motivated by physiological studies related to first task, reaching to grasp, and a simple control method composed of joint-damping and a single virtual spring, we try out for realization of continuous reaching-to-preshaping movements by robotic hand-arm systems with a pair of {2DOFs} fingers and a {3DOFs} arm. Differently from conventional researches, this paper treats neither trajectories planning nor inverse kinematics. Instead of those, a few transit point and desired point in task-space and a control method with Jacobian transpose and joint velocity damping are merely adopted. Based on results of numerical computer simulation, it is concluded that it is possible to simply realize continuous robotic reaching-to-preshaping motion by adopting the transit points and the control method},

Any two were considered identical in pattern when both the finger positions and the contact areas were alike. Fourteen identical patterns were identified: five patterns of power grip, four of intermediate grip, four of precision grip, and one other. Eighty-six percent of the grips shown by the subjects could be fitted into one of these prehension patterns, and the remaining 14 percent into intermediate or combined patterns. For all 7 subjects, 31 of 98 objects were grasped in an identical pattern and the rest of the objects, 67, in 2 or more patterns.},

@article{Pollard2004Closure,
    abstract = {One goal of grasp selection for robotics is to choose contact points that guarantee properties such as force- or form-closure. Many efficient algorithms have been developed to address this problem, but most of these algorithms focus on grasps having a minimal number of contact points. Increasing the number of contacts can dramatically improve the quality and flexibility of grasps that are constructed. However, computation time becomes a problem, as grasp synthesis algorithms that can be generalized to an arbitrary number of contacts typically require time exponential in the number of contacts. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for synthesis of many-contact grasps. The key idea is to geometrically construct families of grasps around a single example such that all grasps within a family meet user-specified design goals. We show that our construction technique can be used to form force-closure grasps, partial force-closure grasps, and grasps above a quality threshold. Our approach requires time polynomial in the number of contacts, making it feasible to handle grasps with relatively large numbers of contacts. Results are shown for three-dimensional grasps with friction having five to twelve contacts and specialized for a variety of tasks. We have used this approach to design grasps for a robot hand and quasi-static manipulation plans for a humanoid robot. 10.1177/0278364904044402},

Using concepts from differential geometry, I derive a set of equations, called the contact equations, that embody this relationship. I employ the contact equations to design the following applications to be executed by an end-effector with tactile sensing capability: ( 1) determining the curvature form of an unknown object at a point of contact; and (2) following the surface of an unknown object. The contact equations also serve as a basis for an investigation of the kinematics of grasp. I derive the relation ship between the relative motion of two fingers grasping an object and the motion of the points of contact over the object surface. Based on this analysis, we explore the following applications: (1) rolling a sphere between two arbitrarily shaped fingers ; (2) fine grip adjustment ( i.e., having two fingers that grasp an unknown object locally optimize their grip for maximum stability). 10.1177/027836498800700302},

    abstract = {Usually, grasp planning can be split into two phases. In the first phase one tries to find a set of contacts that allow for stable grasping of an object. In the second phase a feasible hand pose that realizes the grasp with a given hand is calculated. While this point is important for a practical grasp planning system, it has either been considered trivial or been solved by crude heuristics in most cases. Here we present an approach for calculating the hand and finger pose for a given grasp. The problem is formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem and then solved using optimization techniques. The method is applied to two different grasp types: the well known precision grasp and the pinch grasp which is preferred by men when grasping small objects.},

@inproceedings{Rosales2008Finding,
    abstract = {Planning a precision grasp for a robot hand is usually decomposed into two main steps. First, a set of contact points over the object surface must be determined, ensuring they allow a stable grasp. Second, the inverse kinematics of the robot hand must be solved to verify whether the contact points can actually be reached. Whereas the first problem has been largely solved in a general posing, the second one has only been tackled with local convergence methods. These methods only provide one solution to the problem, even if many are possible, and depending on the initial estimation they use, they may fail to converge, which results in grasp re-planning in situations where it could be avoided. This paper overcomes both issues by providing a complete method to solve the kinematics of human-like hands. The method is able to find all possible configurations that reach the specified contact points, even when positive-dimensional sets of such configurations are possible.},

The approach works on the object space, implying that it is always a two-dimensional problem and, since it is not necessary to compute all the force-closure space, it becomes a very fast approach.

    abstract = {Robotic manipulators use contact forces to grasp and manipulate objects in their environments. Fixtures rely on contacts to immobilize workpieces. Mobile robots and humanoids use wheels or feet to generate the contact forces that allow them to locomote. Modeling of the contact interface, therefore, is fundamental to analysis, design, planning, and control of many robotic tasks. This chapter presents an overview of the modeling of contact interfaces, with a particular focus on their use in manipulation tasks, including graspless or nonprehensile manipulation modes such as pushing. Analysis and design of grasps and fixtures also depends on contact modeling, and these are discussed in more detail in Chap. 28. Sections 27.2–27.5 focus on rigid-body models of contact. Section 27.2 describes the kinematic constraints caused by contact, and Sect. 27.3 describes the contact forces that may arise with Coulomb friction. Section 27.4 provides examples of analysis of multicontact manipulation tasks with rigid bodies and Coulomb friction. Section 27.5 extends the analysis to manipulation by pushing. Section 27.6 introduces modeling of contact interfaces, kinematic duality, and pressure distribution. Section 27.7 describes the concept of the friction limit surface and illustrates it with an example demonstrating the construction of a limit surface for a soft contact. Finally, Sect. 27.8 discusses how these more accurate models can be used in fixture analysis and design.},

@article{Liu2004Quality,
    abstract = {Planning a proper set of contact points on a given object/workpiece so as to satisfy a certain optimality criterion is a common problem in grasp synthesis for multifingered robotic hands and in fixture planning for manufacturing automation. In this paper, we formulate the grasp planning problem as optimization problems with respect to three grasp quality functions. The physical significance and properties of each quality function are explained, and computation of the corresponding gradient flows is provided. One noticeable property of some of these quality functions is that the optimal solutions are also force-closure grasps if they do exist for the given object. Furthermore, when specialized to two-fingered or three-fingered grasps on a spherical object, the optimal solutions become the familiar antipodal grasp, or the symmetric grasp, respectively. Thus, by following the gradient flows with arbitrary initial conditions, the optimal grasp synthesis problem is solved for objects with smooth geometries manipulated by hands with any number of fingers. Also, note that our solutions do not involve linearization of the friction cones. We discuss two simplified versions of these problems when real-time solutions are needed, e.g. coordinated manipulation of a robotic hand with contact points servoing. We give simulation and experimental results illustrating validity of the proposed approach for optimal grasp planning. Note to Practitioners: This paper presents three new quality functions for comparing and planning grasps and fixtures. These measures improve on the traditional measure of force closure. We propose a method for computing the optimal solutions of these functions, and a method for reducing their computation time through reasonable simplification/approximation. Preliminary experiments with a three-fingered robotic hand demonstrate that the proposed functions can be used to optimize the grasp quality during manipulation/manufacturing, and keep the optimal grasp configuration once it is reached. However, we only obtain the local optimal solutions for the functions without simplification except for some special cases. We also assume that the object/workpiece is ideally rigid in all three functions. In future research, we will improve these limitations throug- h a compliance model.},

The purpose of such devices is often manifold, and it typically includes grasping and fine manipulation of objects in an accurate, delicate yet firm way. We survey the state-of-the-art reached by scientific research and literature about the problems engendered by these often conflicting requirements, and the work that has been done in this area over the last two decades. Because of space limitations, the chapter does not attempt at providing a survey of the technology of robot hands, but rather it is oriented towards covering the theoretical framework, analytical results, and open problems in robotic manipulation.},

The actuators are completely integrated in the fingers which made possible the design of a very compact and lightweight hand that can either be used as a prosthetic hand or as a humanoid robot hand.

The physical force of this hand is similar to the power of an average human hand, but the size of the artificial hand is still larger.

@book{Canny1988Complexity,
    abstract = {{\_The} Complexity of Robot Motion {\_Planning} makes original contributions both to robotics and to the analysis of algorithms. In this groundbreaking monograph John Canny resolves long-standing problems concerning the complexity of motion planning and, for the central problem of finding a collision free path for a jointed robot in the presence of obstacles, obtains exponential speedups over existing algorithms by applying high-powered new mathematical techniques. Canny's new algorithm for this "generalized movers' problem," the most-studied and basic robot motion planning problem, has a single exponential running time, and is polynomial for any given robot. The algorithm has an optimal running time exponent and is based on the notion of roadmaps - one-dimensional subsets of the robot's configuration space. In deriving the single exponential bound, Canny introduces and reveals the power of two tools that have not been previously used in geometric algorithms: the generalized (multivariable) resultant for a system of polynomials and Whitney's notion of stratified sets. He has also developed a novel representation of object orientation based on unnormalized quaternions which reduces the complexity of the algorithms and enhances their practical applicability. After dealing with the movers' problem, the book next attacks and derives several lower bounds on extensions of the problem: finding the shortest path among polyhedral obstacles, planning with velocity limits, and compliant motion planning with uncertainty. It introduces a clever technique, "path encoding," that allows a proof of {NP}-hardness for the first two problems and then shows that the general form of compliant motion planning, a problem that is the focus of a great deal of recent work in robotics, is non-deterministic exponential time hard. Canny proves this result using a highly original construction. John Canny received his doctorate from {MIT} And is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Division at the University of California, Berkeley. {\_The} Complexity of Robot Motion Planning\_ is the winner of the 1987 {ACM} Doctoral Dissertation Award.},

@book{1990Dextrous,
    abstract = {Manipulation using dextrous robot hands has been an exciting yet frustrating research topic for the last several years. While significant progress has occurred in the design, construction, and low level control of robotic hands, researchers are up against fundamental problems in developing algorithms for real-time computations in multi-sensory processing and motor control. The aim of this book is to explore parallels in sensorimotor integration in dextrous robot and human hands, addressing the basic question of how the next generation of dextrous hands should evolve. By bringing together experimental psychologists, kinesiologists, computer scientists, electrical engineers, and mechanical engineers, the book covers topics that range from human hand usage in prehension and exploration, to the design and use of robotic sensors and multi-fingered hands, and to control and computational architectures for dextrous hand usage. While the ultimate goal of capturing human hand versatility remains elusive, this book makes an important contribution to the design and control of future dextrous robot hands through a simple underlying message: a topic as complex as dextrous manipulation would best be addressed by collaborative, interdisciplinary research, combining high level and low level views, drawing parallels between human studies and analytic approaches, and integrating sensory data with motor commands. As seen in this text, success has been made through the establishment of such collaborative efforts. The future will hold up to expectations only as researchers become aware of advances in parallel fields and as a common vocabulary emerges from integrated perceptions about manipulation.},

This framework can be used to derive planning algorithms that produce stable grasps even for highly complex hand designs. Furthermore, it offers a unified approach for controlling different hands, even if the kinematic structures of the models are significantly different.

The synthesis is based on analysis of the grasping task as performed by human beings. We divide the task into (1) a target approach phase (including target identification, hand structure and grasp mode selection, selection of approach trajectory, hand preshaping and orientation) and (2) a grasp execution phase (including shape and force adaptation). Each aspect of the required control is discussed. Particular attention is paid to the role of geometric modeling in target identification, to preshaping during the approach trajectory and to the requirements for autonomy in completion of the grasping task. The underlying philosophy is that of reflex control; each aspect of the grasping task is initiated and terminated using sensory data and rules of behavior derived from human expertise in such tasks. The contents and organization of the knowledge base which codifies this expertise are discussed. The fundamental assumptions upon which this control philosophy is based are identified throughout the paper. Preliminary results of a graphical simulation of hand preshaping are given.},

    abstract = {Dexterous manipulation refers to the skillful execution of object reorienting and repositioning maneuvers, especially when performed within the grasp of an articulated mechani cal hand. In this paper we study the problem of gaining a secure and enveloping grasp of a two-dimensional object by exploiting sliding at the contacts between the object and the hand. This is done in two steps:first, choosing an initial grasp with which the object can be manipulated away from the support, and second, continuously altering the grasp so that envelopment is achieved. The plans generated by our technique could be executed with only position control. How ever, it would be prudent to incorporate contact force sensing to prevent damage during unexpected events.  The main contributions of this paper are the derivation of liftability regions of a planar object for use in manipulation planning; the use of the lifting phase plane in manipulation planning; and the derivation of the quasi-static forward object motion problem, which provides a basis for general three- dimensional manipulation planning with rolling and/or sliding contacts. 10.1177/027836499000900302},

@article{Romdhane1990Kinestatic,
    abstract = {This paper is concerned with the handling of any object by an articulated multifingered hand. By handling we mean the secure grasp of a general object plus the manipulation of this object by the fingers without motion of the arm on which the hand is mounted. Hypothetical joints are used to express the freedom at the contact of the object with each fingertip. A pair of matrices are introduced that relate the small motions of the joints to the relative displacement of the object and the fingertips and that are derived using reciprocal screws. This analysis permits not only the determination of the necessary conditions for a secure handling of the object but also the investigation of the special configurations that may occur. In the case of a grasp with point contact with friction, a very important result is derived that leads to a considerable sim plification in the analysis of these matrices. It is further shown that there exists a particular point, called the center of the grasp, at which the direction of the force applied to the object does not influence the contact intensities. Following this it is demonstrated that the vector containing the contact intensities, generated by a unit couple applied to the object, generates an ellipsoid defined as the grasp ellipsoid. The two smaller axes of this ellipsoid show where to place the con tacts to minimize the contact forces for a given task. The results are illustrated with numeric examples in appendix C. 10.1177/027836499000900601},

@article{Nakamura1989Dynamics,
    abstract = {This paper discusses the dynamical coordination of multiple robot manipulators or a multifingered robot hand. The coor dination problem is divided into two phases: determining the resultant force by multiple robotic mechanisms; determining the internal force between mechanisms. The resultant force is used for maintaining dynamic equilibrium and for generat ing the restoring force. A dynamic coordinative control scheme which guarantees the object stability is proposed, associated with the determination of the resultant forces. The internal force is used to satisfy the static frictional constraints and is related to contact stability. The minimizing internal force is defined as the internal force which yields the minimal norm force satisfying static frictional constraints and the minimizing internal force is solved by applying a nonlinear programming method. The concept of the minimizing inter nal force is fundamental and important because it can theo retically answer whether the object can be grasped and ma nipulated with the given finger placement. Contact stability means the ability for the end-effector to maintain contact with an object without slipping when the object is subjected to disturbing external forces. A method of evaluating contact stability is developed. The minimal norm force satisfying the specified degree of contact stability can be obtained by using an algorithm similar to that for the minimizing internal force. Numerical examples of computing the minimizing in ternal forces are given. 10.1177/027836498900800204},

The former is similar the singularities in serial chains where velocity manipulability ellipsoid is degenerate and force manipulability ellipsoid infinite. The latter is unique to parallel mechanisms, the velocity manipulability ellipsoid becomes infinite and force manipulability degenerate.

This paper treats two fundamental problems in the study of multi fingered robot hands: grasp planning and the determination of coordinated control laws with point contact models. First, we develop the dual notions of grasp stability and grasp manipulability and propose a procedure for task modeling. Using the task model, we define the structured grasp quality measures, and using these measures we then devise a grasp planning algorithm. Second, based on the assumption of point contact models, we develop a computed torque-like con trol algorithm for the coordinated manipulation of a multi fingered robot hand. This control algorithm, which takes into account both the dynamics of the object and the dynamics of the hand, will realize simultaneously both the position trajec tory of the object and any desired value of internal grasp force. Moreover, the formulation of the control scheme can be easily extended to allow rolling and sliding motion of the fingers with respect to the object. 10.1177/027836498900800402},

Loosely speaking, these properties are related to the capability of the robot to inhibit motions of the workpiece in spite of externally applied forces. In this article, form-closure is considered as a purely geometric property of a set of unilateral (contact) constraints, such as those applied on a workpiece by a mechanical fixture, while force-closure is related to the capability of the particular robotic device being considered to apply forces through contacts. The concepts of partial form- and force-closure properties are introduced and discussed, and an algorithm is proposed to obtain a synthetic geometric description of partial form-closure constraints. Al though the literature abounds with form-closure tests, proposed algorithms for testing force-closure are either approximate or computationally expensive. This article proves the equiva lence of force-closure analysis with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary differential equation, to which Lyapunov's di rect method is applied. This observation leads to an efficient algorithm for assessing the force-closure property of the grasp.},

We make use of a simple   humanlike manipulation strategy in which a single finger is moved at each instant while the other three are maintained fixed (with regard to the palm)--an   extended version of the original finger-tracking scheme of Rus. This new version es sentially incorporates frictional rolling and sliding at the fingertips and deals with the related contact kinematics and quasi-static mo tion/force prediction issues. Our contribution is twofold. First, we describe an analysis showing that this extended scheme is suitable for reducing the space of the object motions,   thereby making motion planning easier and operating on a search space of low dimension. Our second contribution is a planner that exploits such a search space   reduction and applies the extended finger tracking at the core of a multilevel hierarchical framework to search for global reorien tation trajectories. The planner  has been implemented and used for achieving several nontrivial frictional reorientation tasks that show the capabilities and the promise of our approach. 10.1177/02783640122067273},

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method for the motion planning problem of rigid object dexterous manipulation with a robotic multi-fingered hand, under quasi-static movement assumption. This method computes both object and finger trajectories as well as the finger relocation sequence. Its specificity is to use a special structuring of the research space that allows to search for paths directly in the particular subspace {GSn} which is the subspace of all the grasps that can be achieved with n grasping fingers. The solving of the dexterous manipulation planning problem is based upon the exploration of this subspace. The proposed approach captures the connectivity of {GSn} in a graph structure. The answer of the manipulation planning query is then given by searching a path in the computed graph. Simulation experiments were conducted for different dexterous manipulation task examples to validate the proposed method.},

We show that it is not necessary to generate optimal grasps, due to a certain quality measure, for real robot grasping tasks where an average quality grasp is acceptable. We present statistical data that confirm our opinion that a randomized grasp generation algorithm is fast and suitable for the planning of robot grasping tasks.},

To evaluate these models, a study was undertaken of the grasps used by machinists in a small batch manufacturing operation. Based on the study, a taxonomy of grasps was constructed. An expert system was also developed to clarify the issues involved in human grasp choice. Comparisons of the grasp taxonomy, the expert system, and grasp-quality measures derived from the analytic models reveal that the analytic measures are useful for describing grasps in manufacturing tasks despite the limitations in the models. In addition, the grasp taxonomy provides insights for the design of versatile robotic hands for manufacturing},

In such exposition, a critical evaluation of what in the author's view are the leading ideas and emerging trends is privileged with respect to exhaustiveness of citations. The survey is focused mainly on three types of functional requirements a machine hand can be assigned in an artificial system, namely, manipulative dexterity, grasp robustness, and human operability. A basic distinction is made between hands designed for mimicking the human anatomy and physiology,and hands designed to meet restricted, practical requirements. In the latter domain, arguments are presented in favor of a -minimalistic” attitude in the design of hands for practical applications, i.e., use the least number of actuators, the simplest set of sensors, etc., for a given task. To achieve this rather obvious engineering goal is a challenge to our community. The paper illustrates some of the new sometimes difficult, problems that are brought about by building and controlling simpler, more practical devices},

@proceedings{Yoshikawa1996Passive,
    abstract = {This paper provides a unified theoretical framework for grasping and manipulation by robotic grippers and hands as well as for fixing works by fixtures and vises. The concept of passive closure and active closure for general constraining mechanisms is introduced. Passive closure is further classified into passive form closure and passive force closure. Conditions for these closures to hold are studied. Several new conditions are given for passive force closure. Especially, it is shown that, for the existence of passive force closure by frictionless point contacts, there must be at least six fixed contact points in the case of three dimensional space, and at least three in the case of two dimensional space. Conditions for other closures, which are mostly slight modifications of known results, are also included to show that they are naturally located in proper positions in the proposed unified framework},

A general approach for synthesizing two- and three-finger grasps on planar unknown objects is presented. Visual perception is used to reduce the uncertainty and to obtain relevant information about the objects. We focus on non-modeled planar extruded objects, which can represent many real-world objects. In addition, particular mechanical constraints of the robot hand are considered. First, a vision processing module that extracts from object images the relevant information for the grasp synthesis is developed. This is completed with a set of algorithms for synthesizing two- and three-finger grasps taking into account force-closure and contact stability conditions, with a low computational effort. Finally, a procedure for constraining these results to the kinematics of the particular hand, is also developed. In addition, a set of heuristic metrics for assessing the quality of the computed grasps is described. All these components are integrated in a complete system. Experimental results using the Barrett hand are shown and discussed.},

Squeezing the object, or the application of internal grasp forces, is reduced to a linear programming problem which considers friction and joint torque limit constraints. The relationship between the finger-joint motions and the motion of the object, for the case of pure rolling between the finger tips and the object, is formulated as a set of differential equa tions.
