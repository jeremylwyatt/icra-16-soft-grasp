The main purpose of this paper appears to be the
application of the authors' previously published learning
approach to the case of underactuated hands (as opposed to
fully actuated hands in the past). However, no emphasis is
given to the particularities of underactuation, such as
exploiting environmental constraints. All three reviewers
agreed that the technical contribution is therefore
insufficient for a new paper. The evaluations and
references are also insufficient; comparisons to other
underactuated methods would help make the case for the
authors' learning approach in the underactuated context.
