\begin{abstract}
Recently, advances have been made in learning of grasps for fully actuated hands. A typical approach is to learn the target locations of finger links on the object surface. When a new object must be grasped, new finger locations are generated, and a collision free reach-to-grasp trajectory is planned. Such a division of labour fails to exploit the advantages of underactuated hands, which improve grasp reliability via contacts with the object during grasping. In this paper we present a method for learning grasps for underactuated hands. Our approach works by learning not only the desired final grasp, but also good grasping trajectories. We learn these trajectories from example grasps generated with a rigid body simulation of hand and object. This enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated hand so as to induce a favourable sequence of contacts. Our method does not rely on explicit representation of the contact sequence. The core learning method uses a product of experts approach. This allows grasp transfer to novel objects and works despite partial shape reconstruction.
